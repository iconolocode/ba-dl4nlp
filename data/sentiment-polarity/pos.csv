"a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary",pos

"can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral",pos
"proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts",pos
"the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film",pos
"comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears ,  crossroads  instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns",pos
"cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing",pos
"i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings",pos

"no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story",pos
"claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay",pos

"if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time",pos
"despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs",pos
"even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy",pos

"a canny franchise escapade ; it gets the job done",pos
"bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal",pos
"the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda",pos

"son of the bride is slight fare , but it does have it poignancies , and it is well-acted and sweet without being cloying",pos
"the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque",pos
"a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women",pos
"neighbor's dog operates at a consistent chuckle pitch that frequently gives way to guffaws",pos
