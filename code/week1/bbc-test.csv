business,bbc,1990,britain's first full day in erm  britain's first day as a full member of the exchange rate mechanism (erm) of the european monetary system has been marked by hectic trading in the city. more than 500 million shares were traded in the first two hours and by the end of the day the turnover was 1.08 billion shares - the highest daily volume since the 1987 stockmarket crash.  sterling and share prices then settled down towards the end of the day as a reflection of profit taking  with the pound up 1.75pf against the dm at 3.0312.  while the pound today ended comfortably within its 6% bandwidth of value against the dm  the bank of england has warned the limit will eventually need to be narrowed. frankly i am happy about the decision of the british government but i remain vigilant  jacques delors  ec commission president   robin leigh-pemberton  governor of the bank of england said a 2.5% band should be britain's objective  but only once interest and inflation rates reflected that of other ec members:  'i think until we've settled down  until our economic performance  our indicators have converged more closely with the other members  it was absolutely right to go in at 6%.'  the chancellor  john major  has said erm entry is primarily a counter-inflationary measure  but business analysts were not convinced when he dropped interest rates last week 1% to 14%.  however  home buyers are likely to benefit alongside consumers after building society giant halifax decided to cut its mortgage rate from 15.4% to 14.5%  underlying the strengthened pound.  business leaders have warned membership could mean widespread job losses unless uk firms keep wage costs down.  piers morgan  from the institute of directors said: 'to stay competitive our costs can't go up any more than germany's  if they do our companies will become unprofitable.'  some european ministers have expressed concerns britain's entry is a ruse to slow down ec progress towards full monetary union and a single currency.  speaking in luxembourg  mr major argued such a strategy would be illogical:  'it would seem to be rather a rum thing to get into the erm which is a pretty substantive step...purely as a wrecking tactic '  ec commission president jacques delors said: 'frankly i am happy about the decision of the british government but i remain vigilant.'
business,bbc,1990,anger over chairman's 66% pay rise  the chairman of british gas has come under fire for accepting a pay rise ten times the rate of inflation. robert evans has been given a 66% increase  taking his salary from £222 000 to £370 000.  the labour party condemned the rise as 'sheer unbridled greed'.  trade unions for british gas workers said their members would remember the increase when putting in next year's pay claim.  the company was accused last month of ripping off its customers when it reported a 42% surge in pre-tax profits.  british gas is a privatised monopoly  and has no competitors.  'corporate greed'  labour's energy spokesman  frank dobson  said: 'it is a symptom of corporate greed.  'they think that now there are no restrictions on them they can do what they like  and in a sense they can'.  defending its decision  british gas said the chairman's increase was related to the overall performance of the business.  mr evans is not the only boss revealed in recent weeks to have been given a huge salary increase.  prudential's mick newmarch enjoyed a 43% boost. ian prosser  of bass  took 45% more  natwest bank's howard macdonald 60%  and tesco's sir ian mclaurin a massive 330%.
business,other,1990,newest illegal pyramid scheme going up and up  but not away  ″airplane ″ the newest twist on the age-old illegal pyramid scheme  is turning up in communities around the nation  and authorities are urging unsuspecting players not to be taken for a ride.  ″on these pyramid-type schemes  for the most part  the victims are just about as greedy as the promoters ″ said spencer barasch  associate general counsel for the state securities commission in oklahoma  where dozens of ″airplane″ games have sprung up.  ‴airplane’ is like an oklahoma tumbleweed drifting down the street.″  there are variations  but a typical ″airplane″ game is started by a ″pilot″ who persuades two people to pay him an entry fee to be ″co- pilots.″ the fee reportedly has been as high as $1 500  but typically is $100.  the co-pilots  in turn  recruit two players each. these four  who also pay the fee  become ″flight attendants″ and each recruits two ″passengers ″ again for $100.  when a plane is full - say  with 14 entries - the pilot has $1 400 and the pyramid splits in half  with the co-pilots becoming pilots  flight attendants becoming co-pilots  and passengers becoming flight attendants. newly recruited passengers pay the pilot $100 each  and the pyramid continues splitting and growing.  of course  the longer the pyramid is running  the more difficult it is to find willing players. those not yet pilots would lose their money when the pyramid collapses.  such games are called pyramids because a few moneymakers at the top are supported by lots of money-payers at the bottom.  where the game got started is a mystery  but it has been reported in miami; tampa  fla.; oxford  miss.; rochester  n.y.; toronto; los angeles; montreal; indiana; colorado; tennessee; georgia; south carolina and texas.  ″the ‘airplane’ differs from other multilevel pyramid deals in that it doesn’t have a common promoter ″ said barasch. ″it’s just a lot of little airplanes. it’s spreading by word of mouth.″  the game grew so popular at the university of oklahoma that barasch’s commission sent a cease-and-desist order to the inter-fraternity council and asked it to distribute the order to all fraternities.  ″the people i talked to said it has been going on in the dorms for a couple of months ″ said linda lynn  a reporter for the oklahoma daily  the student newspaper.  one student  a freshman who declined to reveal his name  called the game a rip-off after his airplane folded and he lost his $50 entry fee.  ″it’s not guaranteed at all  it’s totally by chance ″ the student said. ″it was really popular and everyone was doing it. i didn’t even think about what i was doing. when i thought about it  i realized i had messed up.″  ″airplane″ was a rage earlier this month at the university of florida in gainesville  where students saw it as a way to make money for spring break.  as many as 1 000 students may have been involved  police said. there were no arrests  although such schemes are punishable by up to a year in prison and a $1 000 fine in florida.  ″it is starting to fizzle ″ said gainesville police lt. alan morrow. ″it’s getting bad publicity and people don’t want to lose money. fads come and go on campus.″  but more than just college campuses are involved.  police in stanton  calif.  broke up an ″airplane″ game at a custom car shop march 12  and cited 132 people under a city code against running gambling establishments. police recovered $9 000 in cash and books and receipts  said police capt. leonard haworth.  authorities find the games difficult to combat. players are not cooperative because they fear losing their investment  and many people see nothing wrong with it.  investment can be small  and those who get in early can make money.  ″but when you look at the cumulative effect and the way these people are defrauded  there is definitely a public interest reason for shutting them down ″ barasch said.  ″it’s a gamble  but it’s not sold that way ″ he said. ″the only way these things can succeed is for people to sell them in a misleading manner.″  the u.s. postal service  which polices pyramid schemes such as chain letters  is aware of the game but has no jurisdiction because the mails are not used  said pete wheeler  regional chief of inspectors in newark  n.j.  so stopping the games is left to local and state authorities  who are hoping the fad will fade. and those like barasch have advice for those thinking about joining such a game: ″our motto in oklahoma is  ’if it sounds too good to be true  it is.‴
business,other,1990,irs returns property of redd foxx  comedian redd foxx got a truckload of personal property back from the internal revenue service  but a gift watch from elvis presley  other expensive jewelry and eight cars will be auctioned to pay back taxes.  the comedian  who made his mark as a junk man in the 1970s tv series ″sanford and son ″ is facing both the ire of the irs and a bankruptcy court.  not long after foxx said he had been ″whitelisted″ and ″whiteballed″ by racism in the the irs  the agency countered with allegations that he spent $373 000 of his $500 000 take from the film ″harlem nights″ on ″wine  women  song and gambling.″ agents raided his home in november to seize his property  and foxx was left with only a bed.  estimates of his tax bill have ranged from $750 000 to $2.9 million.  foxx filed for bankruptcy in 1983  but his tax problems continued to mount. efforts to sell his personal property at auction were halted in february when the question was raised whether the bankruptcy court or the irs had jurisdiction over the property.  foxx said he was pleased with the return of the personal items wednesday  but declined further comment.  ″mr. foxx has made a psychological break from those items and is simply happy to have his personal property back ″ foxx’s attorney  marc risman  said of the items to be auctioned.  risman said a repayment agreement had been worked out with the irs  which has been taking his weekly paycheck  estimated at $20 000. the las vegas resident now performs at the hacienda hotel.  risman said foxx would make installment payments on current and past taxes and will get to keep enough money to cover his living expenses.
business,bbc,2005,islamic finance: from niche to mainstream changes to the tax system unveiled in the budget will potentially make the uk a key world centre in the development of islamic finance - a market currently estimated to be worth $400bn globally.  islamic finance is based on islamic principles and jurisprudence (shariah).  the basic shariah prohibitions are on the earning (or payment) of interest  speculation  contractual uncertainly and transactions which are overly advantageous to one party at the expense of another.  the shariah also prohibits any participation in weapons  pork  gambling  pornography and alcohol businesses.  overcoming most of these prohibitions is very difficult in the conventional finance system.  the islamic finance industry has thus developed various shariah-compliant structures in order to provide investment opportunities and to meet the financing needs of businesses and investors who want to comply with the shariah.  these structures deliver results which are similar to those possible through conventional financing transactions.  shariah-compliant  some of the key islamic financing techniques include ijara (based on the leasing of an asset)  musharaka (equity investment/profit and loss sharing)  istisna (production/construction financing) and salam (forward financing).  all of these techniques can be used to achieve the commercial objectives of 'traditional' financing methods - but in a shariah-compliant way.  however  the one islamic financing vehicle which has been generating all the attention recently is the sukuk. sukuks are asset-backed  shariah-compliant trust certificates.  the closest instrument comparable to them in the conventional financial system would be a bond (notably those issued in relation to a securitisation). however  a traditional bond generates interest and is therefore prohibited under shariah law. the chancellor's changes are likely to be replicated in many other countries sukuks are asset-based and tend to be used in conjunction with an ijara structure - where the lease rental income provides a profit for the sukuk holders - or a musharaka structure  where the profit share provides a return.  holding a sukuk confers a beneficial interest to the holder - in terms of holding a proportional ownership of the underlying asset - as well as the income that it generates.  the sukuk holder also assumes all rights and obligations for the maintenance of the asset. in a conventional bond  the investor has no such beneficial interest (other than perhaps a security interest)  nor rights and obligations and is only entitled to receiving interest.  tax charges  the uk tax system is clear and well developed with regard to the treatment of cash and transaction flows for a conventional bond. up until now  however  the tax law was unable to ensure that the cash and transaction flows for a sukuk were also treated in the same way.  for example: let us say that a uk business wants to buy a factory and so issues a conventional bond to finance its purchase. the business would pay interest to the bondholders  and eventually redeem the bond.  the treatment of tax - income tax  corporation tax  withholding tax  stamp duty and so on - for the cash flows in these transactions are well-established in the current uk tax system  so all parties can be reasonably aware of their risks  obligations and post tax benefits.  alternatively  a uk business which wants to buy the same factory but act in accordance with shariah principles  would issue an ijara sukuk to purchase the factory. the business will pay an ijara rental for the use of the factory which will form the profit to pay the sukuk investors.  up until now  the uk tax system would tax the rent and profit exactly as it would the rental income and profits arising from any other business arrangement.  this is what causes the difficulty  as the tax charge on these flows as 'rent' and 'profit' is much higher than it would have been if the same amount of return had been classed simply as interest.  clearly  this meant that uk businesses or investors who wanted to adhere to the shariah were severely disadvantaged and would  in effect  be unfairly taxed simply for adhering to the requirements of their faith.  reform  the chancellor has introduced legislation which will now treat these sukuk transactions as being similar to conventional bond transactions  thereby removing the tax disadvantage for its use.  this change should lead to a sharp increase in the usage of these kinds of islamic financing instruments - not only by businesses which want to be shariah-compliant  but also by other businesses which want to diversify their investor base and tap into the immense pool of islamic finance in the oil rich middle east.  the chancellor has not only created the framework for london to emerge as the leader in the global islamic finance industry but his changes are likely to be replicated in many other countries.  islamic finance will move from being niche to the mainstream as a viable and valid financing option for all.
business,bbc,2005,us pulls back from steel trade war  the us president george w bush has withdrawn a punitive tax on imported steel to avoid a damaging trade war between the united states and europe. the world trade organisation (wto) last month turned down a us appeal against its july ruling that the duties imposed in march 2002 are illegal. mr bush justified them by saying foreign steel firms were driving us firms out of business with unfair competition and government subsidies. the eu was planning sanctions worth $2.2bn in retaliation against the move but says they will now be dropped. 'not illegal' white house spokesman scott mcclellan reading a statement on behalf of mr bush said: 'these safeguard measures have now achieved their purpose and as a result of changed economic circumstances it is time to lift them.' us trade representative robert zoellick said the tariff decision had been made independently of the eu's threat of retaliation. at no stage did the us administration admit it had acted illegally in breaching wto rules. on hearing the tariffs were being dropped the eu trade minister pascal lamy said: 'this is good news for us.... the important thing is that this sort of thing should not happen again.' it is believed that pressure from the british prime minister tony blair during mr bush's controversial visit to london last month was instrumental in convincing him to lift the tariffs. election pledge the tariffs which added up to 30% to the cost of a range of imported steel products were originally imposed to satisfy an election pledge mr bush made to steel bosses and workers. the us blamed cheap imports for the bankruptcy of 31 steel firms since 1997 with 20 000 job losses. but the eu - which had also suffered 22 200 job losses over four years at the time - said it had not resorted to such measures while it was forced to restructure. president bush may now face a backlash from those workers who said he promised to keep the tariffs in place for three years.

business,other,2005,principles-based versus rules-based: what really matters   “principles-based” or “rules-based ” that is the question. in the last year  there has been significant debate over how regulation in the financial services industry should be patterned. the united kingdom’s financial services authority has been a leader in this debate  declaring strong commitment to a principles-based system. underscoring that  in april it issued a paper entitled: “principles-based regulation — focusing on the outcomes that matter.” the paper advocated principles-based regulation and stated that the united kingdom is gradually moving to such a regulatory model. unfortunately  the debate over principles-based versus rules-based regulation has largely focused on these two terms while losing sight of the regulatory objectives underlying the debate. the fsa should have more properly emphasized the subtitle of its paper — “focusing on the outcomes that matter” — rather than its main title. that is because  in designing the appropriate regulatory system  it is the outcomes that matter: where do the industry and the regulators want to be? where should they be? in devising a regulatory system  the participants must first define their objectives  and then develop the process to achieve those outcomes. our regulatory structure faces more important issues than whether it is principles- or rules-based. the fact is that any efficient regulatory system is likely to have aspects of both. for example  in the u. s. securities markets we have rule 10b-5 of the securities exchange act of 1934  which prohibits both acts of fraud in the purchase or sale of securities and manipulative or deceptive behavior in our markets. rule 10b-5 is extremely broad and principles-based. yet there are specific rules which deal with fraud in certain situations (for example  rule 13e-3 in tender offers). our primary self-regulatory organization  the financial industry regulatory authority of new york and washington  has a principles-based concept called “just and equitable principles of trade.” yet finra also has many specific rules which underlie this concept and govern sales and trading. no doubt  no matter how principles-based you wish regulation to become  it will still need specific rules  in many cases  to achieve the desired regulatory outcomes. good rules are derived from solid principles and provide guidance to the marketplace. the fsa recognizes this duplication of principles and companion rules in its april 2007 paper. in a march 26 speech before the compliance and legal division conference of the washington- and new york-based securities industry and financial markets association  securities and exchange commission member annette l. nazareth advocated that the focus be on “prudential regulation.” she defined that as “having a clear set of standards with a more flexible implementation approach for meeting those standards” and “permitting regulated entities to meet their obligations in a more customized — as opposed to ‘one-size-fits-all’ — manner.” ms. nazareth suggested that this approach would yield more efficient but not less effective regulation. she noted  however  that prudential regulation may be more applicable to areas such as risk management  and may not be as appropriate in a sales practice context “where investor-protection concerns may necessitate a more rules-based approach.” ideally  the debate over principles- versus rules-based regulation  or even prudential-type regulation  will lead to a consideration of larger  more pressing outcomes relating to both the u.s. domestic regulatory structure and international regulation. modernization of our rules should be one of the primary outcomes we seek as we re-address our regulatory structure. our regulatory systems woefully lag behind the businesses they regulate  primarily as the result of human capital and innovation  global expansion of our markets  new products and advancements in communications and technology. regulators and industry leaders need to work together to update and streamline the rules and provide for a more efficient  reasonable regulatory structure. efforts have been made in this regard  but they have been sporadic and isolated. modernization of rules is a full-time project which needs to be addressed on a full-time basis. another important outcome for the industry and regulators is regulatory consolidation and harmony. the merger of the nasd and the regulatory arm of the new york stock exchange is a very significant step in this direction. the establishment of finra should eliminate duplication and reduce costs. in time  finra will hopefully have a single  more modernized rules book. but one may ask more cynically why finra and nyse regulation still maintain separate enforcement staffs. more important  as markets expand globally  international regulatory harmonization should be a natural outgrowth. though we have already seen mergers of market platforms on a global level — such as the nyse/euronext merger and the nasdaq/borse dubai acquisition of 47.6% of the omx nordic exchange — we should expect and strive for similar international regulatory harmonization. an important step is for securities regulators in the more prominent jurisdictions worldwide  in coordination with the industry  to cooperate in determining common — or at least a similar set of —general principles and rules. those principles and rules would govern the conduct of participants in our global markets and set common standards for cross-border business and enforcement procedures. the sec is exploring means to facilitate global market access and enhance harmonization. in june the sec hosted a round-table discussion on mutual recognition  at which representatives of u.s. and foreign exchanges  global and regional broker-dealers  retail and institutional investors and others shared their views on possible approaches to cross-border issues. the sec’s goal is to develop a “mutual recognition” regulatory approach to certain “recognized” jurisdictions that strikes a balance between securing the benefits of greater cross-border access to investment opportunities  while vigorously upholding its mandate to protect investors  foster capital formation and maintain fair  orderly and efficient markets. a further desired outcome is for the industry and regulators worldwide to work together to develop a regulatory system that is both reasonable and fair in its effects on both firms and investors. the united states is proud of its self-regulatory model  where industry has a voice in shaping regulation. we should expand this concept globally so that the industry and its regulators can produce a global system that is efficient  practical and robust. to this end  we need the cooperation of all securities regulators throughout our global markets to work together in promoting broad common goals and objectives in international regulation. in addition to being reasonable and fair  today’s regulatory principles and rules must provide for flexibility  particularly in terms of implementation and applicability. our global securities markets continue to experience rapid change and development. technology fosters new products  provides advanced data and communications systems and promotes access and transparency. today’s firms range from fully-diversified global organizations to smaller local broker-dealers with a more limited product base. regulation needs to account for these changes  the industry’s growth and the differences between firms. it is very important that senior management of our financial institutions —whether global organizations or regional firms — actively participates in these regulatory discussions. their engagement in this process can help pave the way to modernized rules that are reasonable  fair and flexible while also encouraging international regulatory cooperation and consolidation. one of the reasons for principles-based regulation  as set forth in the fsa paper  is to encourage senior management to better align the economic and business interests of their firms with the regulatory goals of a principles-based approach  and give senior management the flexibility to do what is right without being wedded to proscriptive rules. whether in the u.k. or the united states  and whether under a principles- or rules-based system  senior management is currently expected to set high standards regarding compliance and professionalism within the securities industry. these industry leaders need to “walk the talk” and promote a strong culture of compliance within their own firms on a worldwide basis. what better way for them to do so than to engage publicly in regulatory dialogue and make it an important component of the business framework. the active involvement of senior management in both domestic and global regulatory discussions will ensure that regulation will become an important part of business decision-making  and not be viewed as merely an incidental  cost-draining mechanism. senior management should advocate and push explicitly for the regulatory outcomes suggested herein: rules modernization  consolidation and harmony  reasoned regulation that is fair to all market participants  and the flexible implementation of regulation. it is time to finally leave behind the debate about principles- and rules-based regulation  and instead elevate the dialogue between firms’ senior management and regulators to discuss and agree on desired outcomes. rules modernization  consolidation and harmony  and reasonable and fair regulation that is flexible in implementation are key desired outcomes. should we achieve these objectives  securities regulation will be a more fruitful  more efficient  less costly system that will benefit both industry participants and investors worldwide.
business,bbc,2020,us consumer prices rise at fastest rate since 1982  washington is under pressure to address the issue  with the us central bank expected to raise interest rates.  the bank of england has already raised interest rates twice in the last three months in a bid to dampen down consumer spending by making borrowing more expensive.  in the us  consumer spending held strong for much of last year despite the rapidly rising prices  which analysts say have been caused by a mix of robust demand  government spending  supply chain hold-ups and pay increases following labour shortages.  amazon  netflix and procter & gamble are among the many firms that have announced price rises in recent months  citing higher costs. they have said they expect most households to absorb the increases.  but the issue is increasingly a key issue for voters  hurting president joe biden's popularity despite strong economic growth last year.  in a statement  mr biden pledged that his administration would 'be all hands on deck to win this fight'  acknowledging that 'americans' budgets are being stretched in ways that create real stress at the kitchen table'.
business,bbc,2020,crypto exchange binance to take $200m stake in forbes binance   one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency firms  will take a $200m (£147.6m) stake in forbes in the latest twist for the 105-year-old media brand.  forbes  known for its ranking of billionaires  said the deal would help make it a leader supplying information about digital assets  like bitcoin.  but news of the investment sparked questions among media watchers about potential conflicts of interest.  binance sued forbes in 2020 for defamation  later dropping the case.  analysts also noted that crypto assets have proven particularly vulnerable to manipulation by celebrities and media hype  prompting warnings from regulators around the world.  in a statement announcing the investment  binance founder changpeng 'cz' zhao said he saw media as 'an essential element to build widespread consumer understanding and education' of the crypto market and emerging blockchain technologies.  the chinese canadian billionaire  whose net worth is estimated to be nearly $100bn  later took to twitter to clarify his comments  saying his focus was on helping forbes build out its technology and calling forbes' editorial independence 'sacrosanct'. he told broadcaster cnbc that his firm was also eyeing investments in other traditional companies as it looks to advance adoption of blockchain  a system for recording transactions that uses a shared  decentralised ledger. forbes said binance - which has faced scrutiny from regulators in the us  uk and elsewhere - would provide technology advice  helping the business publication 'maximize its brand' and advance plans to convert readers to paying subscribers.  it said the deal would not change its areas of coverage  but hopefully allow its existing digital assets team and 'some other beats' to grow over time.  'forbes has been fiercely independent for more than a century  regardless of our ownership  and that is not changing ' spokesman bill hankes told the bbc. 'the integrity of our trusted journalism is our most important brand asset.'  the deal comes at a key moment for the crypto industry. currencies such as bitcoin have seen values skyrocket  while companies have been spending on sports stadium sponsorships  advertising and government lobbying to expand their influence and shape anticipated regulation.  many crypto firms have been branching out into new areas  including media  as they look to increase their reach  said henri arslanian  a partner at pwc who frequently advises crypto firms. he added even if both sides promise independence  the tie-up between binance and a major us media brand will raise questions  'binance buying part of forbes is like mcdonald's buying part of yelp or marriott buying part of trip advisor ' he wrote on twitter.  'even though there might not be a direct conflict of interest  i think the perception will remain ' he later told the bbc. forbes  founded in 1917  was for decades family-owned with a name made covering the titans of the business world. but as with many in the media industry  its transition from print to digital has been rocky.  in 2013  the forbes family put the business up for sale and hong kong-based integrated whale media acquired a majority stake.  last august  forbes said it would list publicly on the new york stock exchange via a merger with magnum opus  a firm established to buy companies looking to go public.  the firms said the deal  which valued forbes at roughly $630m and is expected to be finalised within weeks  would come with a $400m investment by other partners. binance is now behind half of that sum.  'forbes is committed to demystifying the complexities and providing helpful information about blockchain technologies and all emerging digital assets ' forbes chief executive mike federle said.

business,other,2020,uk exports to eu fell by £20bn last year  new ons data shows  uk exports of goods to the eu have fallen by £20bn compared with the last period of stable trade with europe  according to official figures marking the first full year since brexit.  numbers released on friday by the office for national statistics (ons) showed that the combined impact of the pandemic and britain’s exit from the single market caused a 12% fall in exports between january and december last year compared with 2018.  highlighting the disproportionate impact of leaving the eu  exports to the rest of the world excluding the 27-nation bloc dropped by a much smaller £10bn  or about 6% compared with 2018 levels. the ons compared trade performance against figures from three years ago because that was the last year before distortions caused by firms stockpiling ahead of brexit deadlines and the spread of covid-19.  despite the disruption  the eu remains the uk’s largest trading partner. however  for the first time since comparable records began in 1997  the uk now spends more importing goods from the rest of the world than it does from the eu.  uk goods imported from the eu were down almost 17%  or about £45bn  compared with 2018. in comparison  imports from the rest of the world increased by almost 13%  or about £28bn. with the eu accounting for just over half of uk exports worldwide  economists said brexit was serving as an extra headwind for britain  compounding the disruption from covid being felt across advanced economies. “uk exporters are continuing to lose market share ” said gabriella dickens  an economist at the consultancy pantheon macroeconomics.  although trade levels have picked up in recent months  data from the netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis show that real goods exports from advanced economies were 3.8% above their 2018 average in november  outpacing the uk.  the hardest-hit commodities recorded dramatic falls. outbound shipments of clothing and footwear to the eu were both down by almost 60% compared with 2018. food and live animal exports – for which more stringent border checks are required – were down almost 18%  while vegetable exports dropped by almost 40%. shipments of cars to the eu  heavily disrupted by global supply chain issues and covid  were down by a quarter.  guillermo larbalestier  a trade economist at the university of sussex  said the drop in vegetable exports was probably linked to a fall in the number of seasonal workers available to pick and process crops  more burdensome paperwork and the difficulty in exporting perishable goods in the face of extended delays at the border.  clothing exports have been affected because a high proportion of garments sold by uk retailers are made in asia or the us  making them ineligible for the tariffs negotiated in the post-brexit trade deal.
business,other,2020,greggs superfans bode well for primark tie-up: ‘i really like beige food’ affection for the pasty and sandwich brand is running high ahead of official merchandise hitting stores  beth kweeday really loves greggs. the 23-year-old tattoo apprentice from liverpool is such a fan of the high street baker that she got a tattoo of its signature sausage roll in branded packaging on her calf last november as an eternal reminder of the shop she visits more than five times a week.  but what is it about greggs that made her want to commemorate their produce on her body? “i really like beige food  so it’s pretty much a dream for me. and i like that it’s dead cheap as well.”  kweeday starts her mornings with a greggs vegan sausage roll  sometimes pops back in for a cheese pickle sandwich for lunch  and if she’s feeling peckish in the afternoon she might return for a chocolate muffin.  surprisingly  kweeday’s fierce love for the high street stalwart is not unique. she is one of many greggs superfans happy to wear their passion for the chain loudly and proudly.  the retailer is now hoping that fans and casual customers alike will snap up official branded merchandise as part of a high-profile collaboration announced this week with the budget clothing shop primark. but fans have been finding their own ways to honour greggs for some time. independent sellers peddle pregnancy t-shirts with a preggs logo  earrings painstakingly crafted to resemble greggs pastries  greggs-printed leggings  and any number of greetings cards  which typically convey how much the sender prefers greggs to their recipient.  leah bernard  19  who runs the etsy shop bernard bits  sells earrings resembling greggs sausage rolls in branded bags. a prototype she posted on tiktok went viral  securing 1.6m views. they’re now one of the most popular items she sells  especially among the lgbt community. “i often get messages saying ‘this is a gift to my friend who’s obsessed with greggs’ ” she said.  she thinks greggs’ popularity is down to its heritage as a “typical british caff”. “if you spoke to someone not from the uk  that’s the first thing you’d mention. nowhere else has it.”  pasty  a drag queen based in london whose greggs-inspired burlesque routine – in which she bursts out of a branded paper bag in a sausage roll costume – launched her performing career  agrees that the chain’s appeal stems from tapping into british culture.  her greggs routine went viral on tiktok  receiving plaudits from kylie minogue and years and years  with many commenters praising it as exemplary “british drag”  a self-deprecating  comedy-driven subversion of its glamorous american counterpart. “it’s funny and absurd. someone said ‘try explaining this to anyone who’s not british’. i don’t think anyone outside of the uk would understand greggs hype.”  it’s perhaps this match of uk food culture with the down-to-earth  irreverent tone that is a hallmark of british humour that greggs fans find so compelling. tamsin mclaren  who runs the university of bath’s prestigious marketing degree  said greggs’ “tireless pursuit of understanding their customer” had made it an iconic brand. “greggs honest and inclusive tone of voice chimes with many who are bored by false promises and inflated prices of premium brands ” she said.  the partnership with primark is a natural continuation. the fact they are “behaving like premium or luxury brands”  for instance by launching the clothing collection at an exclusive pop-up in soho  “enhances greggs’ image as a brand with humour and not afraid to be self-deprecating via irony”  she said. the brand’s success at a difficult time for the uk high street is testament to the strength of this approach. while there were several high-profile high street closures during the pandemic  greggs plans to double the size of the business and expand from 2 115 to 3 000 sites in the near future.  greggs’ chief executive  roger whiteside  has said the secret lies in its savvy marketing and openness to new trends – exemplified by the carefully timed introduction of a vegan sausage roll. greggs superfans agree.  “they really go with the times ” said pasty. “when my [show] was happening  they shared the clip on social media. i’m a drag queen and not many brands would do that.”  greggs’s appeal is as much rooted in familiarity as it is in novelty  she says. “for everyone in the uk  if you’re in town and you need something quick you get a sausage roll for a quid from greggs. it’s cheap  easy food and a staple of everyone’s memory.”
entertainment,bbc,1990,pavarotti sings in the british rain  italian tenor luciano pavarotti has given a huge free concert in london's hyde park to celebrate 30 years in opera. a crowd of 100 000 - out of an expected 250 000 - stood in the rain to watch pavarotti perform 20 arias by verdi  puccini  bizet and wagner.  it was the biggest outdoor music event in hyde park since the rolling stones performed there in 1969. i discovered opera during the world cup  terry hall  woolwich  vips - who paid up to £400 per ticket - included the princess of wales  prime minister john major and michael caine. they got soaked in the downpour along with everyone else.  crowd chants to lower umbrellas gave way to the great man's voice when he appeared on the specially made pink-canopied neo-classical stage at 1900 bst.  but by the end of the evening st john's ambulance had treated 193 people for the effects of the cold.  some fans - like terry hall  22  from woolwich - had camped overnight to get a prime spot in the 50 acre site.  'i discovered opera during the world cup when one of pavarotti's songs (nessun dorma) was used as the tune ' he said.  a woman working on a merchandising stall insisted it was 'really a very middle-class crowd'.  but even though she sold 1 000 pavarotti t-shirts - costing £10 each - organiser oliver goldsmith doubts he will recover much of the £900 000 he paid to stage the concert.  the royal parks plant a tree appeal will receive £100 000 from the event.  pavarotti contributed to the cause by planting a tree near the concert venue before a press conference today.
entertainment,bbc,1990,search ends for loch ness monster  a major sonar exploration of loch ness in scotland has failed to find a monster. searchers on operation deepscan spent a week on the loch using £1-million worth of equipment to scan the lake.  the flotilla of 24 boats did pick up three sonar 'contacts' shown on paper as crescent shaped marks.  they indicated something big in the waters below urquhart castle but this could have been a seal or a group of salmon.  project leader adrian shine  who has been looking for 'nessie' for many years  told the bbc: 'i think if we were to get a fish on the scale that the contacts would suggest then i don't think anyone would be too dissatisfied and all those eye-witnesses would get their vindication.'  sightings  the legend of the monster dates back to the 6th century but it was not until the 1930s that the myth really took off.  in 1933  mr and mrs george spicer told newspapers they saw a monster  measuring 40 to 50 ft (12 to 15 m) long  crossing the road near the loch.  'although i accelerated quickly towards it ' he said  'it had disappeared into the loch by the time i reached the spot.  'there was no sign of it in the water. i am a temperate man  but i am willing to take any oath that we saw this loch ness beast. i am certain that this creature was of a prehistoric species.'  there have been numerous sightings since then - and numerous hoaxes.  in the 1970s  a photograph taken by dr robert rhines attracted worldwide attention. it seemed to show a flipper or fin of the monster.  the creature in the photo was even given a scientific name - nessiteras rhombopteryx by the famous naturalist sir peter scott.  published in the top journal nature  the name meant 'ness wonder with a diamond shaped fin' however  it didn't take long for some sceptical minds to point out that the name was also an anagram - 'monster hoax by sir peter s'.  it was later revealed that the image had been computer enhanced.
entertainment,other,1990,the phantom of the opera  we have had some pretty grim experiences in musical theatre in recent years. we have seen people turned into roller-skating ciphers  dwarfed by laser-beams and sententious holograms and treated as pawns in political chess-games. but the cheering thing about the phantom of the opera is that it puts spectacle (and there is plenty of it) to the service of an exciting story and in that music is used  in a pucciniesque way to intensify a dramatic situation.  andrew lloyd webber and richard stilgoe  responsible for the book  have had the shrewd idea of going back to gaston leroux's original 1911 novel. so we get a story that mixes horror and romance in equal proportions: horror in that it is about the terrorisation of the paris opera house by an elusive phantom who causes multiple deaths when his demands are not met  romance in that it is a beauty and the beast myth about a disfigured hero who can only express his love for a soprano by becoming her musical inspiration.  it may be hokum but it is hokum here treated with hand on heart rather than tongue in cheek. and even if one misses some of leroux's grislier details  such as the final incarceration of the soprano's rescue in a hexagonal  water-filled torture-chamber  the palpable sincerity means that there is never any danger of the phantom of the opera becoming like the marx brother's night at the opera.  we are made to care about the people (though raoul  the romantic rescuer  seems a bit wimpy compared to the figure of purbind obstinacy leroux created). but much of the success of the evening lies in lloyd webber's ability to move from operatic pastiche to music full of plangent yearning.  resisting the temptation to use lashings of gounod  he gives us a mixture of metro-goldwyn meyerbeer  cod-mozart and  in the phantom's own don juan opera  something that is 1860s avant-garde. lloyd webber's own prevailing style  however  is lush  romantic  string-filled and  if occasionally one achingly passionate number threatens to merge into another  the effect is offset by the comic jauntiness of prima donna or the pavane-like stateliness of masquerade with neat lyrics ('masquerade-paper faces on parade ') by charles hart.  this last number is one of many whose effect is heightened by the masterly direction of harold prince and designs of maria bjornson. the occasion is a new year's eve masked ball at the opera house and a grand sweeping staircase (ms bjornson is very fond of staircases) is filled with a kaleidoscopic harlequinade which suddenly parts to reveal the phantom who has come as the red death. it is a powerful moment and it exemplifies the consistent delight in theatricality.  prince and bjornson throughout stress the sinister opulence of the paris opera with heavy  swagged curtains  bulging  gilt caryatids and  most spectacularly  a descent into the underworld via a tilting bridge that leads to a candle-filled lake reminiscent of one of mad ludwig's bavarian castles. and if the famous chandelier's ascent was slightly more exciting than its ultimate descent that was because we all know that what goes up must come down.  but prince has caught the feverish  nightmarish bustle of leroux's opera house without diminishing the people. michael crawford as the phantom  above all  brings out the character's solitary pathos rather than his demonic horror: it is the humanity under the mask that seizes the attention  not least when his flickering  desperate hands suddenly emerge from behind an angel of music hovering over the lovers on the opera house rooftop.  sarah brighman sings sweetly and prettily as christine without quite suggesting she'd be the overnight toast of paris. and even if steve barton can't do much with the underwritten raoul  there is strong support from rosemary ashe as the displaced prima donna whose voice suddenly turns to a frog-croak and from john savident as a comically officious opera house manager.  in the end the phantom works  despite the odd blank stretch  because it delights in the possibilities of theatre: from a vast prop elephant (operated by beer-swilling stagehands) to the demonking disappearance of its hero through the floor-surface. it is determinedly old-fashioned but when the new fashion is for boy-meets-laser-beam  it is refreshing to find a musical that pins its faith in people  narrative and traditional illusion.

entertainment,other,2005,museum unveils wax hitler  berlin's new waxwork museum on thursday unveiled a figure of a glum-looking adolf hitler in a mock bunker during the last days of his life  an exhibit that has been criticised as being in bad taste. the row over the figure overshadowed the media preview of the new branch of madame tussaud's which opens its doors to the public on saturday.  critics say it is inappropriate to display the nazi dictator  who started world war two and ordered the extermination of europe's jews  in a museum alongside celebrities  pop stars  world statesmen and sporting heroes.   'of course the figure will arouse interest but we hope people will realise he is part of an exhibition with a range of attractions ' said meike schulze  head of midway attractions in germany which is responsible for madame tussaud's here.  'it will be a shame if he dominates everything.'   her plea appeared to fall on deaf ears.  bush  merkel ignored  about 200 reporters and cameramen all but ignored us president george w bush  german chancellor angela merkel  plus the likes of beethoven  albert einstein  madonna and brad pitt.  instead  they pushed and jostled to peer into a dark corner where the unmistakable figure of hitler is seated.  dressed in a grey suit  hitler gazes downwards with a despondent stare  his arm outstretched on a large wooden table with a map of europe on the wall of his gloomy bunker.  'we wanted to show him like this  in the last days of his life ' said schulze who defended the decision to put him on show  saying market research had shown there was demand for his inclusion  as long his portrayal was sensitive.  about 25 workers spent about four months on the waxwork  using more than 2 000 pictures and pieces of archive material and also guided by a model of the 'fuehrer' in the london branch of madame tussaud's where he is standing upright.  it is illegal in germany to show nazi symbols and art glorifying hitler and the exhibit is cordoned off to stop visitors posing with him.  out of respect  unobtrusive signs ask visitors to refrain from taking photos or posing with hitler 'out of respect for the millions of people who died during world war two'. camera surveillance and museum officials will stop inappropriate behaviour  said schulze.  institutions such as the foundation for germany's central holocaust memorial site have condemned the idea of the exhibit as tasteless  saying it had been included to generate business.  however  the wax figure is the latest in a gradual breaking down of taboos about hitler.  the 2004 film downfall provoked controversy as it portrayed the leader in a human light during the last days of his life and last year a satire about hitler by swiss-born jewish director dani levy was released in germany.

entertainment,bbc,2020,inventing anna: the netflix show versus reality  'this whole story is completely true. except for the parts that are completely made up.'  so begins every episode of netflix's long-awaited new series inventing anna  about fraudster anna delvey  aka anna sorokin.  twenty-something anna conned friends and banks out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by masquerading as a rich heiress in new york city  before the law caught up with her.  her story first exploded on social media in 2018  just as netflix's big new signing - producer shonda rhimes - was looking for a juicy project.  racing to screen the ‘fake heiress’ story my strange encounters with a fake heiress anna sorokin: 'crime pays  in a way' the creative powerhouse behind grey's anatomy and scandal leapt on it  and netflix signed a rights deal with anna - then in pre-trial detention - for $320 000 (£240 000).  the nine-part drama series is expected to be a hit. but how does its portrayal of the scandal compare to what we know about the real thing? here's a look at some of the key characters. the story is told through the eyes of journalist vivian kent  played by anna chlumsky (veep). the character is loosely inspired by jessica pressler  from new york magazine  who wrote the first in-depth account of the wannabe socialite's exploits. during the series  vivian makes multiple prison visits to anna - as she did in real life - and develops an obsession with her story  as it takes over her life. while vivian has a chequered past as a journalist and is desperate for a hit story  jessica has fine form. one of her previous articles became hollywood film hustlers  starring jennifer lopez.  when the scandal came to light  rachel deloache williams was its most prominent character  apart from anna herself. she was a vanity fair photo editor when she befriended anna and started riding her coat-tails around the city.  rachel was later hit by a $62 000 bill for an extravagant six-night trip they took to morocco. she gave a tearful testimony in court about how she had been under the impression that anna would cover all their costs  and said she suffered stress and anxiety over the unexpected debt.  inventing anna's version of rachel is not favourable; she is portrayed as superficial and self-obsessed. the real rachel told her side of the story in a book  my friend anna  and an adaptation was in development with hbo. she did not co-operate with netflix and wrote a scathing response to the series on the air mail website last week  accusing the company of running 'pr for a con woman'. the real kacy was an anonymous source in the original story and largely shied away from the media when the story first exploded on social media. a high-end fitness trainer  she has worked with countless hollywood stars  including dakota johnson  bruce willis and kirsten dunst. she was employed by anna for $300 per session during a period when the 'heiress' had boosted her funds by defrauding a bank.  kacy didn't come out of the experience too badly  apart from catching food poisoning on the morocco trip (although this got her out of the bill-paying debacle). but she says she really did have to deal with anna's awkward sit-in in her apartment lobby  when her former client had nowhere else to go as things started to fall apart.  in inventing anna  kacy is played by laverne cox (orange is the new black) and kacy seems delighted by the casting. 'consider me a proud twin! thank you queen!'  she posted on instagram. neffatari (neff) davis was the concierge who befriended anna during her stay at the luxury 11 howard hotel  where she racked up huge bills. when the story initially went viral  paper magazine called her the 'millennial everywoman' at the heart of the story.  the pair seemed to rekindle their friendship when anna was released from prison in 2021  and neff has recently been promoting the series with nostalgic instagram posts. 'you're the thelma to my louise. and even though i don't agree with all the things you've done in this lifetime  i could never be shady and forget about you ' she wrote. anna's lawyer todd spodek received plenty of attention during the trial  as he pursued 'fake-it-til-you-make-it' as a defence strategy. he opened and closed his argument with lyrics from frank sinatra's new york  new york  insisting his client was just trying to be successful in the big city. (he has a history of offering a lyrical defence. he once recited a few lines of marvin gaye's 'what's going on' to open a patricide case.)  inventing anna implies he took on her case for notoriety and  sure enough  he is now known in the media as the 'fake heiress' lawyer. this moniker was used most recently when he was linked to another big new york case  representing a juror from the ghislaine maxwell trial. like kacy and neff  todd was a consultant for the inventing anna series. he is portrayed by arian moayed  who played stewy in succession.  todd told the bbc the actor did a phenomenal job. but he said he did not take on the case for no fee  as is implied  and no journalist helped him out with his case work.

entertainment,other,2020,sheila heti: ‘books by women still get treated differently from those by men’  after her controversial novel about motherhood  the canadian author has turned the spotlight on her father. she talks about grief  honesty – and her decision not to have children. sheila heti hadn’t intended to write a book about grief  but in late 2018  about a year after she’d started writing her new novel  pure colour  her father died. “he had been sick  but it was always going to be a shock. it has been the most profound change i’ve experienced in adulthood  having a parent die. mother and father are connected to what life is  and you know all along they aren’t the sky  the earth – they’re people. but while your mind knows it  maybe your body doesn’t ” she says. as a result of the shock  she adds  the story in her book “suddenly breaks”.  heti and i are sitting in her cosy second-floor apartment in toronto  which she shares with her boyfriend of 11 years  luc  and their friendly rottweiler  feldman. outside  a blizzard blows  but feldman keeps us both warm by snoozing on our feet. a mutual friend had told me beforehand that the 45-year-old heti “will seem young to you”  and  with her girlish voice and 1990s teenager outfit of a long-sleeved t-shirt beneath a cotton blue dress  she does at first. but she seems older than i expected  too. her short  pixie-like fringe  which she had when she wrote her previous bestselling novels  2010’s how should a person be? and 2018’s motherhood  has gone (“i just grew out of it”)  and she has a quietness and perceptiveness that is often overlooked by critics  who mistake her originality for kookiness. it is easy to imagine her  simultaneously  as the precociously artsy girl she once was and the pin‑sharp older woman she will one day be.  pure colour pure colour exemplifies both that originality and sharpness. it encompasses the beginning and end of the world  and adam and eve  as well as her character mira’s entire life  all within a slim 200 and some pages; it’s the kind of book that you start reading again as soon as you finish it  to see how on earth the author pulled it off. “with my other books  i thought as i was writing: ‘ok  this friend is going to read this and i want the book to tell this to them.’ but with this book there was no thought of that. i just felt completely cut off and it became more intuitive ” heti says. as a result  the novel has a dreaminess to it  and some sections read as though they come straight from heti’s subconscious  such as when mira’s grief for her father so overwhelms her that she becomes  for quite an extended time  a leaf. “that was how [grief] felt for me – not so much being out of my body  but just feeling very far from everyone and not part of the active world ” heti reflects.  as a teenager growing up in toronto  the daughter of hungarian jewish immigrants  heti loved books by writers such as henry miller  edmund white and the marquis de sade. they gave her a sense of the novel as a medium without a template: she could do anything that she wanted with it. in the very funny and tender how should a person be?  a late-twentysomething called sheila mooches around toronto and new york and talks with her friends – sometimes in prose  sometimes in script format – as she tries to answer the eponymous question.  how should a person be? in the more interior and occasionally feverish motherhood  a late-thirtysomething  also called sheila  mooches around toronto  talks with her friends and boyfriend  miles  and tries to figure out if she wants to have a baby.  the novels might sound similar  but they are completely different in tone and mood  with the earlier work capturing the self-awareness and self-doubt of one’s 20s  and the latter mining the panic and anxiety that besets a certain kind of thirtysomething. because they feature so much autobiography  many critics described them as autofiction  akin to karl ove knausgård and rachel cusk. heti used to wince at the word  but now accepts that “it’s a useful term because it helps people’s expectations of the book. i just call it fiction  though. all writers use their lives. look at proust – it’s all fucking autofiction ” she says. her repeated use of autobiography means that heti’s books illuminate one another: in motherhood  she writes that her mother’s criticism of her as a child made her “desperate to live as a person beyond criticism; to prove that i was better than any of the ways she saw me”  which casts a new light on the title of her first novel. motherhood focuses primarily on her complicated relationship with her mother  while her father  the playful caregiver  is glimpsed only in the shadows. now  in pure colour  she brings him into the light.  unlike the previous two books  pure colour is written in the third person  and it is not asking a central question: the narrator is entirely certain what she’s talking about  telling the reader from the start why people are how they are  and why the world is as it is. this is partly a reflection of heti herself – “yes  i do feel more certain in myself now ” she agrees – and also because this is a novel about middle age  that point in life when “the party is happening behind a closed door”  as the book puts it  when there aren’t so many questions to be asked  just things to deal with. initially  pure colour feels wistful and lightly satirical  with the narrator explaining that we are all living in god’s “first draft of existence”. mira marvels at the passing of time since her youth  before the internet and social media  and what she describes as “the friendship revolution  which made being in touch of primary importance”. but then  suddenly  mira’s father dies  and the story becomes something heti was not expecting. “i didn’t think the experience [of my father dying] would be part of the book  but then i thought  ‘oh  first draft of existence …’ it feels like you’re in the second draft  after the death of a parent  because it is like the world has ended  right? i saw how all of those things came together ” she says.  no writer likes to be told their novel is reminiscent of someone else’s  so it is with some trepidation that i tell her at times pure colour made me think of patricia lockwood’s no one is talking about this  which was shortlisted for the booker prize last year  and which also combines grief with jokey observations about how technology has changed the world. she nods.  “yes  patricia and i are friends  and a few years ago we were telling each other about our books  and i said  ‘these books have a lot in common!’ so we exchanged manuscripts and  structurally  they feel very similar ” she says.  for me  heti’s is the stronger book  with descriptions of grief that are so surprising and true they made me gasp: “she had thought that  when someone died  it would be like they went into a different room ” she writes. “she had not known that life itself transformed into a different room  and trapped you in it without them.”
entertainment,other,2020,‘justice can triumph’: painting looted by nazis returned to owners after 80 years  approximately 80 years after it was looted by the nazis  an expressionist painting has been returned to the descendants of a german-jewish couple by the royal museums of fine arts in brussels.  flowers  a 1913 still life by the german artist lovis corinth  was entrusted to the museums in 1951  because postwar investigators were unable to trace the original owners.  after years of research  the painting has been returned  the first restitution of any artwork looted from a jewish family in the second world war by the royal museums of fine arts  which covers six museums  with works spanning the old masters to magritte.  thomas dermine  belgium’s secretary of state in charge of museums  handed the work to a lawyer representing the nine great-grandchildren of gustav and emma mayer  a german-jewish couple who fled germany in 1938.  “this restitution  the first by the museums of fine arts  is a very strong signal: even decades later  justice can triumph ” dermine said. the return of the painting was also “an opportunity to remind people of the horrors” to which nationalism and the far right could lead  he said. “to repair is to remember and to remember is to avoid the return of the worst.”  the mayers ran a successful business in frankfurt before fleeing the nazi persecution. they owned 30 paintings  which were left in storage in brussels after a 14-month stay in the belgian capital from 1938-39. flowers is the only one to have been recovered.  lawyers for the family approached the museums in 2016  eight years after it launched an online database about 27 works of uncertain provenance in the collections as part of an effort to find owners.  imke gielen  a lawyer with the berlin firm von trott  who is acting for the mayers’ descendants  said it was a historic day for the family. “they are delighted that at least one of the missing paintings has been identified after 80 years and has now been returned.”  the nine descendants  who live in the uk  south africa and us  have yet to decide what to do with the painting  she said  adding: “today is the day of restitution which we celebrate and other things will come in the next few days. the family has to decide.”  gustav and emma mayer arrived in brussels in june 1938  after fleeing through italy and switzerland. in august 1939  days before the outbreak of war  they made it to britain and settled in bournemouth.  their eldest son  ernst  was interned with other german-jewish refugees as an “enemy alien” on the isle of man. gustav mayer  in poor health when he left germany  died in his mid-80s in 1940 of natural causes  although his death may have been hastened by the trauma of persecution and the difficult journey. his wife emma died in 1944. they never saw their paintings again. in 1942 a few works from the mayer collection disappeared when the nazi special taskforce led by hitler’s acolyte  alfred rosenberg  began its work of plundering cultural treasures that belonged to european jews.  by 1943 all the mayer property in brussels had been stolen. one highlight of the collection was a painting of a horseman on the beach by max liebermann  one of the leading impressionists in germany. there were also other works by corinth  as well as lesser-known frankfurt artists.  michel draguet  the museum’s director  said he felt no sadness that the work would leave the museum  where it had been on display in the modern art collection.  “we never bought this painting  we were never the owners  we were the custodians for the belgian state.” he and all his staff felt they were fulfilling the museum’s role in society  he said.  draguet had scored out the painting from the museum’s inventory  a brown foolscap a4-sized book  with the word “register” printed in french and dutch on the front.  the handover ceremony took place in a new exhibition room showing other works given to the museum in 1951  when belgium’s postwar economic recovery service  the body in charge of restitution of missing art  was disbanded. the owners of the original works  a mix of old masters and 19th-century landscapes  have either never been identified or there are questions about how they were acquired.  one work by the 17th-century bavarian artist hans rottenhammer  diana and callisto  was bought by a curator employed by hermann göring in 1941 from a brussels art collector. nothing of the work’s ownership before 1941 is known  raising questions about a possible forced sale.  the mayers’ descendants repaid the german government the “small compensation” award they had received in the 1970s for the loss of flowers  gielen  their lawyer  said.  meanwhile  aided by researchers  the family continue to search for the 29 missing paintings  which are registered on the german government database  lostart.de.  for now  there are no leads. “we have no images; we have descriptions  not all of them are very detailed so unfortunately ” gielen said. “none of the other works has been identified yet.”
politics,bbc,1990,ireland elects first woman president  voters in the republic of ireland have chosen their first female president. unofficial returns suggest that mary robinson  who is standing as an independent  took nearly 40% of the vote in the first round.  ireland's system of proportional representation means the result will not be confirmed until tomorrow.  but mrs robinson's performance in the first round means it is now impossible for anybody else to win.  senior sources in the camp of her main opponent  former deputy prime minister  brian lenihan  have already conceded victory to mrs robinson.  it is the first time in 70 years that a presidential candidate put up by mr lenihan's party  fianna fail  has been defeated.  mrs robinson  a dublin barrister  is considered radical by irish terms.  a civil and human rights lawyer  she has campaigned for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting divorce and abortion for more than 20 years.  however  she not only won the support of women countrywide but also polled well in traditionally conservative rural areas.  the mother-of-three has been a member of the irish senate for more than 20 years.  she twice ran unsuccessfully for parliament as a labour candidate.  but five years ago she resigned from the irish labour party over the anglo-irish agreement because she felt unionists in northern ireland had not been consulted.
politics,bbc,1990,superpowers to cut nuclear warheads  the united states and the soviet union have signed an historic agreement reducing their stockpiles of nuclear warheads by about a third. the strategic arms reduction treaty  known as start  was signed in moscow by us president george bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev.  at a joint news conference after the signing ceremony  mr bush described the start treaty as 'a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust'.  mr gorbachev said it promised to be the start of 'an irreversible process' of arms reduction  but stressed there was 'still a lot to do'.  lengthy negotiations  the agreement took more than nine years to negotiate  and reduces each side's strategic nuclear weapons by about 35% over seven years.  the soviet union's land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles will also be cut by 50%.  it is the first major agreement between the two countries over arms reduction since the salt treaties  signed in 1972 and 1979  which limited the numbers of long-range nuclear missiles.  the start treaty goes further  however  by committing the superpowers to scaling down their fleets of nuclear missiles and bombers  rather than just limiting expansion.  however  it still leaves the us and the soviet union with 9 000 and 7 000 warheads respectively. there was also no agreement over space weapons  or sea-launched cruise missiles.  cooperation  throughout the two-day summit  the emphasis has been on a new era of cooperation between the two sides.  mr bush and mr gorbachev spent much of their time discussing mr gorbachev's attempts to reform the ailing soviet economy and the help that might be offered by the west  although neither leader would be drawn on specific details.  they are also understood to have discussed a jointly-sponsored middle east peace conference.  mr bush's visit takes place at a time of increasing unrest in the soviet republics.  six months ago moscow put down an uprising in lithuania  and just yesterday six lithuanian border guards were killed in suspicious circumstances.  both mr bush and mr gorbachev said they regretted the incident  but refused to comment further.  in an indication of the delicate balance of power in the soviet union  mr bush has taken time during his visit to meet the president of the russian republic  boris yeltsin  for private talks.  however  he was quick to reassure journalists in moscow he continues to support mr gorbachev and the soviet government.
politics,other,1990,major hits out at cabinet  john major's rage and frustration with rightwing tories boiled over this weekend when  in an outburst  he called three of his own cabinet members 'bastards'. the onslaught against the eurosceptic ministers not named  but almost certainly michael howard  peter lilley and michael portillo came within minutes of the vote of confidence on friday which kept him in office.  his obvious anger  and contempt for tory opponents  is certain to keep open the party's wounds after the maastricht furore. it will help convince rightwingers that mr major is even more embittered against them than he has admitted.  the attack  which will also tend to undermine the prime minister's 'nice guy' image  is on video tape  recorded when he did not know he could still be heard. he had just given an interview at downing street to itn's political editor  michael brunson. they were about to tape 'cutaways'  the supposedly silent shots used to cover gaps in an edited interview.  neither mr brunson nor mr major knew that the line was still open  and was being monitored by bbc technical staff who were waiting to record their own interview with the prime minister.  the bbc staff have now made a bootleg transcription of the tape  which shows the two men talking together in the near-darkness. mr major was presumably off his guard  since the tv lights had been turned off.  in the number ten tape he is remarkably frank  discussing the options which faced him when he knew he was going to lose last thursday's first maastricht vote. most damaging of all  he implies that he would like to sack his rightwing cabinet colleagues  but fears the political storm he would have to face.  the tape shows mr brunson (whose voice is less clear  presumably because his microphone was either detached or switched off) sympathising with mr major over his difficulties.  mr major comes through more clearly: 'the real problem is one of a tiny majority. don't overlook that. i could have all these clever  decisive things which people wanted me to do but i would have split the conservative party into smithereens. and you would have said i had acted like a ham-fisted leader.'  mr brunson raises the problem of the three rebel cabinet ministers who threatened resignation if mr major agreed to the social chapter in order to secure ratification of the maastricht treaty. 'i'd better not mention them in this room ' he says  but they are believed to be mr howard  mr lilley and mr portillo. why  mr brunson asks  should he not simply sack them?  mr major: 'just think it through from my perspective. you are the prime minister  with a majority of 18  a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was  and is now invented (clearly a reference to the time of mrs thatcher's leadership). you have three rightwing members of the cabinet who actually resign. what happens in the parliamentary party?'  mr brunson observes that tory mps would create a lot of fuss  but that mr major is prime minister. he could easily find three new cabinet members.  mr major then bares his soul. 'i could bring in other people. but where do you think most of this poison is coming from? from the dispossessed and the never-possessed. you can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.  'we don't want another three more of the bastards out there. what's lyndon johnson's maxim?...'  at this point someone  presumably an itn technician  realised what was happening and pulled the plug. 'johnson's maxim' was his reference to fbi director j. edgar hoover  whom he declined to sack on the basis that 'it's probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside pissing in'.  the number ten tape demonstrates that mr major also fears rightwingers could gain a standard bearer who might challenge him for the leadership if he were to get rid of them from his cabinet.  the tape is certain to cause another row between downing street and the broadcasters. the bbc cannot be blamed for the leak  but it is highly sensitive to similar technical glitches: last year there was a dispute when michael heseltine was accidentally filmed without his knowledge admitting he had not been informed about the latest interest rate cut.  mr major is also concerned about who interviews him: on friday he refused to go into the ring with jeremy paxman for newsnight. instead he agreed to be questioned by the bbc's political editor  robin oakley.  tory whips spent a lot of time last week trying to persuade mps that the maastricht opponents were no more than frustrated non-office holders. one senior whip told colleagues that sir peter tapsell  who voted against the government  had been 'in and out of the whips' office begging for a cabinet job.'  it also became clear that the prime minister has written off the christchurch by-election  where he plans to blame defeat on the recession and the split in the tory party.  two opinion polls  published today  show the tories set to lose the by-election by the highest swings against a government party since 1945. an icm poll for the sunday express gives the liberal democrats 54 percent of the vote while an nop-independent on sunday poll put their support at 62 percent. 
politics,other,1990,we do too need lieutenant governors  the old story about calvin coolidge certainly summarizes the attitude toward the office of lieutenant governor espoused by the post ('anyone for lieutenant governor?' editorial  march 27).  one evening when silent cal was lieutenant governor of massachusetts  he was seated next to an attractive woman at an official dinner.  'tell me ' she gushed  'what do you do?'  'i'm the lieutenant governor ' he said.  'that's wonderful. tell me all about it ' his dinner companion requested.  'i just did ' was the succinct reply.  that old image of the lieutenant governor as a stand-in and ribbon-cutter is no longer valid. many states are finding important new roles for their lieutenant governors. the leadership abilities of lieutenant governors will be in greater demand as state governments find more pressure to produce creative solutions to critical problems.  lieutenant governors can organize and take the lead on many important projects. i'm not suggesting that every time a governor wants to run a controversial proposal up the flagpole  the lieutenant governor be atop the pole with a lightning rod. but a lieutenant governor can use his or her past experiences and present access to state leaders to add depth and reach to an administration.  abolishing the office is the wrong answer to the right problem -- how to make the lieutenant governor a contributing member of state government. as the post has pointed out  a number of states afford the lieutenant governor a tremendous degree of authority in leading their respective state senates.  yet i must take issue with the statement that the office is generally bereft of useful work. for example  by law in indiana  the lieutenant governor directs the department of commerce  which includes economic development  agriculture and tourism. i am not alone in holding such responsibilities. again by way of example  the lieutenant governor of nevada heads the state's departments of economic development and tourism  my colleague in kansas chairs the state's tax review commission  pennsylvania's lieutenant governor heads the state's emergency management agency  and other lieutenant governors across the nation chair or serve on a multitude of commissions  boards and councils. in most states  the governor has also assigned additional duties to the lieutenant governor.  three states have recently reviewed their office of lieutenant governor (or lack of it) and have reached conclusions opposite those raised by the post. new jersey's governor called earlier this year for the creation of the office of lieutenant governor in his state. in new york  after a great deal of input  a legislative committee recommended strengthening the office by adding duties  rather than abolishing it. in kentucky  the house of representatives easily turned back an attempt last month to reduce the office to a part-time position with no significant responsibilities.  in illinois  where democratic primary voters have nominated two candidates out of the mainstream of traditional values to run on their statewide ticket  including one for lieutenant governor  the cry is not to abolish what is an effective office. rather  a move is under way to extend the practice of team general elections for governor and lieutenant governor -- where a vote is cast for one party's candidates for the two offices together  a requirement in 22 states -- to team nominations  a statutory device used in eight states to ensure an even greater degree of personal  political and ideological compatibility between the governor and lieutenant governor.  calvin coolidge was called silent cal because of his reticence. today's lieutenant governors have a lot more to talk about.

politics,bbc,2005,monarchy remains 'political taboo'  2005 will be an election year in britain. as she enjoys christmas with her family at sandringham  the queen can rest easy that the future of the monarchy will not be on the political agenda. but should it be?  pressure group republic has urged politicians on all sides to engage in a debate over the future of the monarchy  which they claim is an anachronism in a modern  democratic society.  stephen pound mp  one of several labour backbenchers who support the aims of republic  told the bbc news website: 'most mps keep very quiet on the subject. they don't want to stick their head above the parapet.  'but i say 'let's get it out in the open and let's have a proper discussion about the issue'.'  'queen has played a blinder'  the mp for ealing north said few would doubt the queen had 'played a blinder' but there was no reason why the monarchy could not stay in a ceremonial role with an elected head of state.  labour is expected to push through the removal of the 92 remaining hereditary members of the house of lords early in the next parliament  if elected  but it has no interest in touching the monarchy's position.  a labour spokesman told the bbc news website: 'we are fully supportive of the royal family and believe they do a lot of hard work for this country as ambassadors for britain. 'we don't believe in any change to the present system and this is not an issue that has been raised in any significant form during our national policy forum consultation process or during the big conversation.'  the conservatives and the liberal democrats also confirmed they had no plans to address the subject in their election manifesto.  a liberal democrat spokesman said it was a very emotive subject and added: 'we would be happy to debate the issue but it's difficult to do if the government will not table the parliamentary time.'  as for the snp  it has proposed that the queen would remain head of state when scotland became independent. they would then offer scots a referendum on becoming a republic.  republic's spokesman  professor stephen haseler  said: 'none of the parties have addressed the issue.  'archaic and feudal'  'it's rather like the old adage about the elephant in the room. everybody knows it's there but nobody wants to say anything.'  prof haseler said: 'very few people still believe that in the modern day the eldest son should inherit the title of head of state. it's archaic and feudal. we are landed with it because of history.'  getting rid of the hereditary peers in the house of lords is 'another nail in the coffin of the monarchy' and the issue will be unavoidable after the queen dies  he said. 'mary robinson was particularly popular when she was president.'  but professor bob worcester  founder of pollsters mori  told the bbc news website there was a widespread misconception among the 'liberal media' that the popularity of the monarchy was on the wane.  he said: 'our most recent polls suggest only one in five britons are in favour of abolishing the monarchy and replacing them with an elected head of state - and that figure has remained stable for some time.'  prof worcester added: 'the reason for that is a mixture of fondness for royalty and suspicion of the presidential system. people acknowledge the stability that it brings and recognise the magnificent job the queen has done.'  he admitted the queen had a 'personal vote' of her own but he said that beneath that there was a bedrock of support for the institution of the monarchy itself.
politics,other,2005,ohio voting rights advocates dealt blow after federal election  redistricting bill stalls  ohio advocates holding out for election reform are  for now  on their own after the u.s. senate dealt a fatal blow to voting rights legislation this week.     the proposal – which combines two bills – would have established rules for voting by mail and ballot drop boxes  expanded early voting options and permitted same-day registration. it also would have banned partisan gerrymandering and restored federal oversight of election laws in states with a history of discrimination.     democrats pushed the changes as gop-controlled states introduced legislation that advocates say would suppress turnout by minority voters. the back-and-forth came to a head wednesday when republicans blocked the bill and democrats failed to muster enough support to change procedural rules to pass it without them.     “they’re on the wrong side of history  these 52 members ' sen. sherrod brown said  referring to the 50 republicans and democratic sens. kyrsten sinema of arizona and joe manchin of west virginia.     the bill was supported by ohio democrats in the u.s. house and senate and opposed by all republicans. it's unclear where congressional democrats will go from here  but rep. joyce beatty  d-columbus  said wednesday that she and the congressional black caucus were prepared for this outcome.     'today is just our first step ' she said during a news conference. 'we will come up to bat with a clear plan.'     election reform and redistricting the vote in washington came days after the ohio supreme court struck down the state's legislative and congressional maps  arguing they were gerrymandered to favor republicans and violated voter-approved redistricting rules. mapmakers must now redraw the lines to ensure they pass constitutional muster.      jen miller  executive director of the league of women voters of ohio  argued the process is further proof that federal reform would help states like ohio.      'despite demands by voters to end gerrymandering in 2015 and 2018 at the ballot box  we’ve seen more of the same: a breakdown along party lines  a complete lack of transparency  and rigged maps ' she said in an email.     gop state lawmakers also introduced multiple election bills last year that would limit drop boxes and change rules for early voting  while allowing people to request absentee ballots online. the proposals have since stalled in committees.     republicans  for their part  viewed the federal legislation as overreach. in a call with reporters wednesday  sen. rob portman accused democrats of casting doubt on the election process with claims of voter suppression – likening them to republicans who incorrectly say former president donald trump won in 2020.      'they have consistently attacked some republicans  saying that they made false claims that there was fraud in the election and therefore made people wonder about the legitimacy of the elections ' portman said. 'ok  i get that. now they’re doing the same thing themselves.'      secretary of state frank larose said republicans tend to overblow the existence of fraud while democrats emphasize voter suppression – all for their own political motives. he said ohio may need to further reform its redistricting process but argued a federal 'one-size-fits-all' policy isn't the answer.      larose also dismissed independent redistricting commissions  which chief justice maureen o'connor suggested voters consider because state officials are 'seemingly unwilling to put aside partisan concerns.'     'i don’t think there’s any group of angels that are truly independent  that don’t have any personal bias or party leanings or belief system that are just going to sit down and draw completely unbiased maps ' said larose  a republican. 'i think that a so-called independent commission kind of forces partisans to pretend they’re not  which is dangerous as well.'
politics,other,2005,obama hails 'significant breakthrough' at climate talks  president obama and other officials are heralding a last-minute  non-binding accord at the conclusion of the united nations climate change conference in denmark.  'we've made meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough in copenhagen ' the president said.  a senior administration official said the leaders of five key countries  including china and india  agreed to a political 'accord' that will 'provide the foundation for an eventual legally binding treaty.'  nevertheless  critics are dismissing the agreement as 'a sham.'  the accord was finalized after obama 'barged into' a meeting between chinese premier wen jiabao  indian prime minister manmohan singh and south african president jacob zuma  who were discussing how they would verify any promised cuts in emissions.  'mr. premier  are you ready to see me? are you ready?' obama said to wen  according to a pool reporter who was with the president.  the leaders proceeded to talk for roughly 45 minutes and emerged with a non-binding political accord  but obama was unable to get the four leaders to commit to a deadline of 2010 for a legally binding international climate change treaty.  obama said the nations will submit to international consultation and analysis of their efforts to cut emissions  similar to how the world trade organization examines economic progress.  it won't be legally binding and there is no set timeframe  but it will allow each country to show to the world its progress  and countries will lay out the targets in an appendix to the agreement.  the president said he hopes to make the agreement legally binding in a year  but he said it will be 'very hard and take some time.'  'we were modest in what we thought we could accomplish ... but believe whatever we promise we can deliver on ' the president said following the meeting with the three leaders.  stalemate on climate change broken environmental groups were disappointed that a more concrete agreeement did not emerge from the conference.  friends of the earth  in a statement  called the accord  'a sham agreement with no real requirements for any countries. this is not a strong deal or a just one -- it isn't even a real one. it's just repackaging old positions and pretending they're new.'  the chinese had for weeks been reluctant to agree to ways for the international community to verify that they're abiding by pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. but today  chinese officials agreed to report to an international monitoring mechanism  officials said.  'for the first time these emerging economies have agreed to take significant action to combat climate change ' the official said  adding that the leaders of the four nations have agreed to the core components obama laid out in his address this morning upon arriving in denmark -- mitigation  transparency  and financing.  he defined 'mitigation' as every major economy putting forward 'decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions  and begin to turn the corner on climate change.' the u.s. goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 'in the range of 17 percent by 2020  and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation.'  transparency  he defined as having 'a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments  and exchange this information in a transparent manner. these measures need not be intrusive  or infringe upon sovereignty. they must  however  ensure that an accord is credible  and that we're living up to our obligations.' an agreement without that would 'be a hollow victory ' he said.  third  the president pushed the world's wealthier economies to help 'developing countries adapt  particularly the least developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change.'  the white house has been working on getting a sign-off from the group of developing nations known as the g-77 by working with ethiopia's prime minister meles zinawi  the official said.  president obama flew to copenhagen on the last day of the conference as the prospects of climate change agreement looked dim. white house officials indicated earlier today that chinese officials were unmoving on their refusal to allow a transparent verification system  a stance that will make a deal difficult to achieve.  world leaders were looking to obama to help break the deadlock at the climate conference.  the original goal of the climate change conference was a legally binding international treaty reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide  but with china has been hesitant to commit to serious greenhouse gas emission cuts and it became clear months ago that would not happen.  leaders from more than 190 countries spent the last two weeks working on a more informal climate change agreement  but that might be out of reach too.  obama met with jibao for nearly an hour today to press the case that china needs to allow for transparency.  obama and wen directed their negotiators to work on a bilateral basis and with negotiators from other countries to see if an agreement can be reached here.  a senior white house official in copenhagen told abc news earlier today that the chinese were holding their ground.  'we've done what we can here ' the official said.'the chinese are dug in on transparency and are refusing to let people know they're living up to their end of the agreement.'  obama pushed for transparency  saying publicly that 'we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments  and to exchange this information in a transparent manner. these measures need not be intrusive  or infringe upon sovereignty. they must  however  ensure that an accord is credible  and that we are living up to our obligations. for without such accountability  any agreement would be empty words on a page.'  he added that the offer was on the table 'if -- and only if -- it is part of the broader accord' including transparency.  in copenhagen  negotiators had worked through the night and met for hours behind closed doors in the hopes of reaching some sort of an agreement  with u.s. officials working quickly to reach a compromise before obama's arrival. the white house had hoped for an agreement before the president's high-stakes visit  but negotiations for a formal treaty had been doomed to failure even before the conference began.  president obama builds momentum in copenhagen in the last-minute push  even secretary of state hillary clinton made an unscheduled appearance to urge on her international counterparts.  china has been hesitant to commit to a deal where it would be open to scrutiny by the international community. leaders from the country have balked at measures to allow international monitors to verify emissions cuts that might be agreed to in the deal.  in the last 24 hours  officials say china had softened its opposition to verification of emissions reductions. clinton announced thursday that the united states will contribute to a $100 billion fund by 2020 to help poor countries cope with climate change  but that financial help is conditional on china relenting on verification  a move that could exert pressure on china.  but china and the united states appeared to be divided on the issue of verification.  the notion that the success of the climate agreements may hinge on the united states and china frustrated leaders of some developing countries.  president obama stressed urgency at copenhagen speaking as the voice of the developing world  brazilian president lula da silva gave a passionate speech where he scolded the developed world for not negotiating on climate change in good faith with poorer nations. he also said this conference is not about climate change  but about economic opportunities for the developing world.  with an array of challenges the president has to confront at home -- from health care to unemployment to the economy -- the president is putting his prestige at stake  both at home and abroad  to fly to copenhagen and seal a deal on an issue that lacks the support of china  one of the biggest polluters in the world.  the u.s. president usually goes on trips like this when an agreement has already been worked out  but the white house said it is not a surprise that obama went. his job as a leader  sources say  is to lead and that's what he wants to do in copenhagen.  obama  whose nobel peace prize win was partially attributed to his efforts on climate change  does not only face the skepticism of an international audience  but even his supporters back home. if he didn't go to copenhagen  he would upset his liberal base.  addressing world leaders earlier today  obama stressed the urgency of coming together on a deal and raised the deflating prospect of a deal.  'while the reality of climate change is not in doubt  i have to be honest  i think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now and it hangs in the balance ' obama said at a plenary session at the united nations summit.  'this is not a perfect agreement  and no country would get everything that it wants ' the president said. 'but here is the bottom line: we can embrace this accord  take a substantial step forward  and continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. we can do that  and everyone who is in this room will be a part of an historic endeavor  one that makes life better for our children and grandchildren.'  obama outlined three key elements that must be in the final agreement. first  all major economies must commit to reducing their emissions. second  there must be a transparent review to ensure nations are keeping their commitments to reduce emissions  and thirdly  there needs to be financing to help developing nations adapt to these new standards.  what world leaders do agree on are the stakes. with unprecedented urgency  a chorus of leaders have delivered the same warning -- the planet is already damaged by climate change and countries need to step up to confront this challenge.  'we have a moral obligation towards future generations ' said prime minister of denmark lars lokke rasmussen.  uk prime minister gordon brown described the stake in apocalyptic terms thursday.  'without common action  extreme temperatures will create a new generation of poor with climate change refugees driven from their homes by drought  climate change evacuees fleeing the threat of drowning  the climate change hungry desperate for lack of food ' brown said. 'hurricanes  floods  typhoons and droughts that were once all regarded as the acts of an invisible god are now revealed to be also the visible acts of man.'
politics,bbc,2020,ukraine tensions: joe biden says us citizens should leave ukraine now  us president joe biden has called on all american citizens remaining in ukraine to leave the country immediately  citing increased threats of russian military action.  mr biden said he would not send troops to rescue americans if moscow invades ukraine.  he warned that 'things could go crazy quickly' in the region.  russia has repeatedly denied any plans to invade ukraine despite massing more than 100 000 troops near the border.  but it has just begun massive military drills with neighbouring belarus  and ukraine has accused russia of blocking its access to the sea.  the kremlin says it wants to enforce 'red lines' to make sure that its former soviet neighbour does not join nato.  uk prime minister boris johnson said on thursday that europe faced its biggest security crisis in decades amid the tensions.  the us state department urged americans in ukraine to leave immediately.  'american citizens should leave now ' mr biden told nbc news.  'we're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. it's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.'  asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing americans  mr biden replied: 'there's not. that's a world war when americans and russia start shooting at one another. we're in a very different world than we've ever been.'  other nations  including the netherlands  japan and south korea  have banned travel to ukraine and urged their citizens in the country to leave as soon as possible.  world leaders  meanwhile  continued their frenzied diplomacy to defuse the current crisis over ukraine.  russia and ukraine announced late on thursday that they had failed to reach any breakthrough after nine hours of talks with french and german officials aimed at ending the separatist conflict in eastern ukraine. ukrainian envoy andriy yermak said while there were disagreements 'there is a will to continue and there is a will to negotiate'.  the current tensions come eight years after russia annexed ukraine's southern crimea peninsula. since then  ukraine's military has been locked in a war with russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near russia's borders.  earlier  the uk prime minister said he hoped 'strong deterrence' and 'patient diplomacy' could find a way through the crisis but the stakes were 'very high'.  in a joint news conference in brussels with nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg  mr johnson said he did not believe russia had yet taken a decision on whether to invade ukraine but the uk's intelligence 'remains grim'.  uk defence secretary ben wallace met his russian counterpart sergei shoigu in moscow on friday.  speaking to reporters after their meeting  mr wallace said he had made it clear that a russian invasion of ukraine would have 'tragic consequences' and that britain wanted to find a way to de-escalate tensions.  he also said that the uk was not currently recommending that its citizens leave ukraine  adding that the foreign office guidance - to only travel to ukraine when necessary - reflected 'where we are at'.  his visit came a day after a frosty encounter between foreign minister sergei lavrov and britain's liz truss.  mr lavrov said relations between the uk and russia 'leave much to be desired' and were at the 'lowest point over the past few years'. ms truss accused russia of 'cold war rhetoric'.  meanwhile  ukraine accused russia of blocking its access to the sea as russia prepares for naval exercises.  ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba said the sea of azov was completely blocked and the black sea almost fully cut off by russian forces.  russia's naval exercises were due to take place next week in the two seas to the south of ukraine  the black sea and the sea of azov.  however  ukraine's border guard service said on friday that russia had told them it had cancelled its drill in the sea of azov  an internal sea bordered by both russia and ukraine. two areas of the black sea will still be closed off for six days from sunday.
politics,bbc,2020,macron refused to take russian covid test  french president emmanuel macron refused a russian covid test ahead of his meeting with russia's vladimir putin  the kremlin has confirmed.  the test required a health protocol that was unacceptable and did not fit with the french leader's schedule  a french source told the bbc.  it follows reports that mr macron refused the pcr test over fears the russians would get hold of his dna.  the leaders subsequently held a socially-distanced meeting on monday.  they did not shake hands and sat with a four-metre-long table between them  with observers wondering whether mr putin was using it to send a diplomatic message.  but french diplomatic sources told reuters that mr macron had been told to choose between accepting a russian pcr test to get closer to putin or abide by strict social distancing rules.  'we knew very well that meant no handshake and that long table. but we could not accept that they get their hands on the president's dna ' one of the sources told reuters.  the source did not elaborate on how the russian intelligence services could exploit mr macron's dna.  a source at the elysée palace told the bbc: 'the conditions imposed for the meeting to take place with no social distancing required a health protocol which were according to us unacceptable and incompatible with the president's schedule.'  the kremlin confirmed that mr macron had been kept at a distance from the russian leader because he had declined to take a russian test.  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said russia understood the french position and it had not affected the talks.  mr macron had carried out a pcr test before leaving france and his doctor carried out an antigen test once they were in moscow  another french diplomatic source told reuters.  'the russians told us putin needed to be kept in a strict health bubble ' the second source told reuters. mr macron is not the only leader to have been subjected to the kremlin's 'long-table' diplomacy - earlier this year  hungarian prime minister viktor orban and iranian president ebrahim raisi were also seen sitting at a distance from mr putin during their visits to moscow.  the kremlin has taken extra precautionary measures to protect mr putin  who later this year turns 70 and who has been given russia's sputnik v vaccine  from getting infected.  however  only three days after meeting mr macron  mr putin hosted kazakhstan's president kassym-jomart tokayev. the pair shook hands and sat with a small coffee table between them. during their meeting mr macron and mr putin spoke for five hours about the tensions over ukraine.  western countries say russia could invade ukraine but russia denies planning to do so despite having massed more than 100 000 troops on ukraine's border.  the us state department has urged americans in ukraine to leave immediately.
politics,other,2020,us plans to reopen solomon islands embassy in push to counter china  washington will reopen its embassy on the island after 29 years  expanding its pacific presence amid china’s growing influence in the region. the united states plans to re-establish an embassy in solomon islands  a senior us state department official said  as washington seeks to beef up its presence in a region where china is rapidly expanding its influence.  secretary of state antony blinken is set to announce the opening of a new embassy on the pacific island state during a visit to nearby fiji – 29 years after the united states downgraded its diplomatic presence in honiara.  the move comes just a few months after riots in the island chain of 800 000 people in november when protesters tried to storm parliament and then went on a three-day rampage  torching much of the capital honiara’s chinatown.the unrest was sparked by opposition to veteran prime minister manasseh sogavare and partly fuelled by poverty  unemployment and inter-island rivalries  but anti-china sentiment also played a role.  the united states closed its embassy in the solomons island capital in 1993 and is now represented by a consulate there  with an embassy in the papua new guinea capital of port moresby.  blinken flew to fiji after a meeting in melbourne of the united states  japan  india and australia  at which the so-called quad pledged to deepen cooperation to ensure an indo-pacific region free from “coercion ” a thinly veiled swipe at china’s economic and military expansion.  in a briefing on the flight  a senior us administration official told travelling reporters that “there are very clear indications that (china) want to create military relationships in the pacific”.  “the most pressing case right now is what’s going on in the solomon islands. with chinese security personnel bucking up an increasingly besieged president in a way that has caused a lot of anxieties across the region ” the official said.  china said in december it would send police advisers and riot gear to solomon islands as foreign peacekeepers began leaving the pacific nation after being deployed during the deadly protests.  a subplot to november’s unrest was sogavare’s efforts to forge closer ties with beijing after abruptly breaking off the island’s longtime ties with taiwan in 2019.  china balks at any official exchanges between other countries and self-ruled taiwan  which it sees as its own territory awaiting reunification.  the solomons government said in december it had accepted beijing’s offer of six “liaison officers” to train its police force and equipment including shields  helmets  batons and other “non-lethal” gear. in recent years china has stepped up pressure to isolate taiwan internationally  getting eight nations to switch diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing since 2016.  a diplomat at the us embassy in port moresby said the reopening of the mission in the solomons islands would build on us efforts to place more diplomatic staff throughout the region.  the aim was to “further engage with our pacific neighbours  connect us programs and resources with needs on the ground  and build people-to-people ties ” the diplomat said.  the us government had provided vaccines and other help to solomon islands in combating the covid-19 pandemic  the diplomat said.  the us congress and the white house will need to approve the embassy proposal.
politics,other,2020,culture wars rage as depopulated spanish region goes to polls  ruling party may need help from rightwing vox to hold on to power after snap election in castilla y león  sam jones in las navas del marqués @swajones sat 12 feb 2022 06.00 gmt  people in the spanish region of castilla y león vote on sunday in a snap election that represents a massive gamble for the ruling conservative people’s party (pp). it could see a breakthrough by a new political platform campaigning on behalf of depopulated and underdeveloped parts of spain.  the vote was called in december after the regional president  the pp’s alfonso fernández mañueco  kicked his partners in the centre-right citizens party out of the coalition government  claiming that he could no longer rely on their loyalty.  it follows a turbulent few weeks in spanish politics that have included a row over the country’s meat industry and rightwing fury after the socialist-led central government managed to get its flagship labour reforms approved by parliament thanks to a pp mp accidentally voting against his party.  buoyed by its performance in national polls – and by its strong result in the madrid region last may – the pp had hoped to use the castilla y león poll to win a majority there and to score an emphatic victory before a looming election in andalucía and next year’s general election.  but its momentum appears to be waning. recent polls suggest that the party  led by pablo casado  will have to rely on the support of the far-right vox party if it wants to remain in office. the socialists are predicted to finish not far behind the pp  with vox in third place and citizens – already a party in its death throes across spain – coming a distant fourth. while the pp has already relied on vox to govern in regions such as madrid and andalucía  relations between the two parties have been strained since october 2020  when casado rounded on the far-right grouping  accusing it of practising a politics based on “fear  anger  resentment and revenge”.  since then  however  casado has dragged his party rightwards and enthusiastically sought out culture wars and wedge issues.  both the pp and vox have seized on comments that the consumer affairs minister  alberto garzón  made in an interview with the guardian last december.  although the minister had renewed his calls for spaniards to reduce their meat consumption for the sake of their health and the planet – and contrasted meat from traditional farming with meat from intensive megafarms – his words were twisted and presented as an attack on spain’s meat industry.  standing in front of a field of cows on a traditional farm near the small town of las navas del marqués in the ávila province of castilla y león last month  casado said the government was “insulting livestock farmers  insulting the mediterranean diet and threatening spain’s international image”.  he also said that megafarms were subject to strict legislation and that  as he saw it  “they don’t cause pollution”. asked why some pp councils had campaigned to stop the construction of new megafarms  casado said those were political decisions.  in recent days  casado has also accused the spanish government of attacking the country’s cheeses  beets  and of spending “a million euros on tourism for other races”.  last week  he suggested that the socialist prime minister  pedro sánchez  presided over a “dracula coalition”  but went on to mix his metaphors by claiming that everyone sánchez bit “turns into a zombie  like him”. with the pp’s fortunes in the traditionally conservative region suddenly in doubt  the party drafted in isabel díaz ayuso  who is widely seen as a possible rival to casado because of her electoral clout and ability to appeal to vox voters.  it did not take her long to stake her conservative credentials. responding to questions about the sexual abuse of children by catholic priests in spain  ayuso said  “all institutions make mistakes”  adding that few people wanted to talk about the church’s cultural legacy in spain or about “the charity  solidarity  values and comfort it offered”.  pablo simón  a political scientist at madrid’s carlos iii university  said things in castilla y león were not going according to plan for casado and his party.  “the problem is that when they called the elections  they thought they’d do so well that they’d be able to govern alone  like in madrid ” he said. “but all the polls point at things getting worse for them than they’d thought.”  anything the pp do now  added simón  will come at a cost: “they’ll either have to depend on vox  with all that depending on a more radical parliamentary partner implies  or they could even lose the government. either scenario is worse for the pp than how things were  or how they wanted them to be.”  simón also noted that the so-called españa vaciada  or hollowed-out spain platform  could play a role in the shape of the new regional parliament as “there are nine provinces that are very different with local phenomena”. voters sick of 35 years of pp rule could decide to give their votes to these grassroots groups on sunday. the people of las navas del marqués  however  are not holding their breath for an imminent improvement in their daily lives.  javier  who owns a bar in the town  said locals were more worried about depopulation and basic services than the meat row. “it’s about all kinds of infrastructure  from telecoms and internet to roads ” he said. “there’s also a shortage of doctors.”  given that most of the meat in the area was raised on traditional farms  he added  few people would take issue with garzón’s words.  miguel  who was born in a house on the main square in las navas del marqués 74 years ago  didn’t hesitate when asked what the most pressing electoral issue was.  “jobs  jobs and jobs ” he said. “people go where the work is and that’s how towns die. a lot of people here have always felt left behind and abandoned by the authorities. castilla y león needs to be thought about a bit more. it’s not just about catalonia and the basque country and andalucía.”
sport,bbc,1990,green light for manchester olympics  officials in manchester bidding to hold the 2000 olympic games have been told their chances are 'very  very high'. the president of the international olympic committee  juan antonio samaranch  was speaking after a series of presentations in the city's town hall.  he has been touring the north-west on the day after the ioc published its report on the technical suitability of the cities competing to host the 2000 games.  the report puts sydney as clear favourite  but gives credit to the british bid and raises doubts over beijing. brasilia fell well below the standard and many expect it to be dismissed from the contest. when i find rain in a country i think always that is a very lucky country  juan antonio samaranch  chairman of the manchester 2000 olympic team bob scott said: 'we've been striving for technical excellence and the report shows this has been delivered. the report shows that manchester has a very strong bid.'  mr samaranch and his entourage were shown the new facilities built and construction underway since their visit three years ago when manchester was trying for the 1996 games.  they travelled on the metrolink tram system  went by helicopter to the equestrian centre at haydock park and saw the north manchester velodrome  due for completion next year.  earlier in the day the ioc visitors soaked up the community support at sandilands infant school in sale and the captain of manchester united  steve bruce  showed off the club's silverware to remind them of the city's rich sporting traditions.  even the rain did not dampen mr samaranch's familiar diplomacy: 'when i find rain in a country i think always that is a very lucky country ' he said.  the president and his team meet the british prime minister tomorrow.  the final decision about who will host the millennium olympic games will be made by the 90 members of the ioc in monte carlo on 23 september.
sport,bbc,1990,man u sold in record takeover deal  manchester united football club has been sold for £20m in the biggest takeover deal in the history of british football. the new owner is isle of man-based property tycoon and former footballer  michael knighton.  manchester united chairman martin edwards is to receive more than £10m for his majority share in the club and will stay on as chief executive.  there had been rumours for some time that mr edwards was planning to sell his stake but the deal was shrouded in secrecy.  the sale of his shares ends 25 years of edwards family control of what has been dubbed 'the world's most famous football team'.  at the press conference to announce the sale he defended what he called his 'sad' decision.  'i believe that under new direction and with new financial backing this club can go even further ' mr edwards said.                           i consider myself to be a football enthusiast first and a businessman second  michael knighton  since taking over at manchester united in 1980 after the death of his father  louis  mr edwards' large annual salary and his sacking of a popular manager have alienated many fans.  manchester united gained its worldwide reputation after a golden era in the 50s under sir matt busby and his 'busby babes'.  players who followed them like bobby charlton  dennis law and george best also helped enhance the club's reputation and its trophy cabinet.  but in recent years manchester united has been - by its standards - in the footballing doldrums and attendance at matches has dropped off.  it is badly in need of a cash injection for both new players and facilities. the new owner has promised to spend £10m refurbishing manchester united's old trafford ground - england's largest stadium apart from wembley.  'manchester united is a legend. it is undoubtedly in my view the greatest football club in the world ' mr knighton told reporters.

sport,other,1990,mr frisk and mr armytage strike another blow for amateurs riders in record time  marcus armytage achieved his lifetime ambition to ride the winner of the seagram grand national at aintree on saturday at the early age of 25  steering the 16-1 chance mr frisk to a threequarters of a length victory over durham edition in a time that beat red rum's 1973 record by almost 14 seconds.  it was the first national to be run in under nine minutes.  not many amateurs are successful in this hardest of all national hunt contests  and dick saunders  at the age of 48  23 years older than armytage  won in 1982 on grittar  the last successful favourite  while the american amateurs  charlie fenwick won on ben nevis in 1980 and tommy smith on jay trump in 1964  but the race really took me back to the days of reynoldstown in 1935/36.  reynoldstown was owned by major frank furlong and was ridden to his first win by his son  the amateur  frank furlong  and on the second occasion by frank's friend  fulke walwyn. walwyn became a successful professional but marcus armytage says he is too heavy ever to join the paid ranks.  to be a success in racing one has to overcome all the hazards on the way and mr frisk did so. when kim bailey bought him on behalf of the american  mrs lois duffey  he apologised at first for buying her a stumer. under the tuition of kim's wife  tracey  he gradually became tractable and saturday's victory was his 14th in all.  mr frisk is one of those rare chasers that are at their best on firm ground. on saturday he was one of the few that really relished the conditions.  it was obvious he would be in the van for the first circuit but i doubted his ability to stay there.  he  polyphemus  uncle merlin  rinus and the favourite  brown windsor  were among the early leaders. after jumping the chair  mr frisk went up to join uncle merlin and actually headed him. they went out on the second circuit together but it was not long before uncle merlin resumed a two length lead.  although no horses were hurt at the dreaded bechers second time  the fence may well have altered the result of the race. uncle merlin was three lengths in front and although he jumped the fence cleanly  stumbled as he put his foot down for a second stride  lowering his head  and hywel davies was thrown.  davies had gone over towards the inside to save ground. richard dunwoody did exactly the same in 1985 on west tip but when he returned the next year dunwoody aimed for the middle of the fence and won the race. i expect that policy will be adopted next time on uncle merlin.  that left mr frisk 15 lengths in front and with no visible challengers  although rinus was in second and durham edition not far behind. from that point  past the canal turn and valentine's  armytage kept mr frisk measuring his fences perfectly.  chris grant  who had come over the last fence on durham edition two years ago with what appeared to be an unassailable lead only to be run out of it by rhyme 'n' reason  and had finished fifth on soft ground last year  was determined not to come too soon on durham edition this time.  grant put in his challenge between the last two  having judged it to perfection. jumping the last two lengths behind mr frisk   he had joined him by the elbow with just about half a length to make up.  armytage  however  got every ounce out of mr frisk on the run-in  using just hands and heels on his father's advice and this sealed the fate of grant and durham edition once again as they just missed by threequarters of a length. nobody  however  could criticise either after such splendidly judged performances.  hywel davies was the only rider to produce a bad-luck story. 'there is no doubt uncle merlin would have won but for the fall at bechers. he will come back here and next time he will win.'  that may well be so  but he would have had to break the record by about 15 seconds to have done so on saturday and that is an arguable point.  uncle merlin won the formidable four mile maryland hunt cup  as did jay trump and ben nevis before their aintree triumphs. there is no doubt that the american race is a wonderful test for the grand national  but the english weather may not be so kind to uncle merlin a year hence.  at least  with a handicap of 8st 13lb in this year's race  tim forster has plenty of leeway for a number of victories with uncle merlin before his weight rises over and above 10st. from start to finish on saturday it was a three horse race  with only uncle merlin  mr frisk   and durham edition in contention.  rinus was about 20 lengths back in third  enabling his rider  neale doughty  to complete the course for the seventh time running.  cheltenham did  in the end  supply the winner  but not from the three winners at the festival meeting  with brown windsor finishing fourth  bigsun sixth  and call collect seventh.  mr frisk had finished fourth in the race won by mr bob on the opening day. it was surprising to hear richard dunwoody say bigsun  backed down to 8-1  was taken off his feet by the fast pace because he had set a record over three miles at cheltenham. brown windsor gave the impression that he failed to stay.  twenty finished the course  with bob tisdall last. bonanza boy  totally unsuited by conditions  finished 16th against eighth last year.  west tip  ridden by peter hobbs  got round for the fifth year running and after a wonderful career will be retired.  the grand national day attendance was 67 235  almost 7 000 doqwn on last year's figure.  course spokesman david donald said: 'the reduction was due to restrictions which were placed on the numbers allowed in the county enclosure and because of a reduction in the number of coach parties which attended.'  total attendance for the three days was 98 287  compared with 102 000 the previous year.  coincidentally  a mister frisky was performing with equal distinction in america. he silenced his doubters by tying a record set by citation and sounding the now-familiar warning to kentucky derby hopefuls everywhere.  the victory was the 16th for the unbeaten mister frisky  equalling citation's score for the longest modern winning streak in north america. his next race will be the kentucky derby on may 5.
sport,other,1990,cantona hits fan  faces lengthy ban  manchester united failed to go top of the premiership last night but that turned out to be the least of their problems. yet again old trafford's season has been thrown into turmoil by the nitro-glycerine in human form that is eric cantona.  for the record  crystal palace deservedly took a point from a scrappy  scruffy match after gareth southgate had brought the scores level 11 minutes from the end  david may having given united the lead early in the second half. thus blackburn rovers still lead the premiership  albeit by one point  and they now have two matches in hand.  the rest paled into insignificance compared with the off-field activities of cantona  who briefly went berserk four minutes after half-time. the frenchman had an thoroughly unhappy evening: from the outset he was complaining about some of the tackling he received and when shaw caught him from behind in the 48th minute the notoriously short gallic fuse was reignited.  a linesman flagged as shaw's tackle went in  and if the referee  alan wilkie  had stopped the play at that point considerable trouble would have been avoided. as it was  cantona kicked shaw as the pair went for a high clearance from schmeichel seconds later.  out came the red card and off went cantona  for the fifth time in 16 months. as he walked along the touchline towards the dressing room a young spectator raced to the front of the stand and as well as hurling abuse  verbal and digital  at the frenchman he appeared to throw something as well.  cantona immediately leapt at the fan  both feet coming in chest-high. the frenchman then threw several punches before police  stewards  team officials and other players pulled the pair apart. in the melee ince appeared to swing a fist at another fan.  two spectators were taken to south norwood police station complaining of assault. cantona now faces another ban for the dismissal and an even longer suspension by the football association which will  in turn  depend on what the police decide to do once they have studied the incident on video.  chief supt terry collins said that both ince and cantona  who were allowed to travel home  would be interviewed by police during the next 48 hours. 'i've never seen anything like it in my life ' he added. 'there could have been a riot.'  the fa was prompt in issuing a statement last night which made the severity of the incidents clear and hinted at equally severe sanctions against cantona.  the statement said: 'the fa are appalled by the incident that took place by the side of the pitch at selhurst park tonight. such an incident brings shame on those involved as well as  more importantly  on the game itself.  'the fa is aware that the police are urgently considering what action they should take. we will as always co-operate in every way with them. and as far as the fa itself is concerned  charges of improper conduct and of bringing the game into disrepute will inevitably and swiftly follow tonight's events.  'it is our responsibility to ensure that actions that damage the game are punished severely. the fa will live up to that responsibility.'  the fa customarily takes a grim view of players and managers assaulting fans. brian clough was banned from the touchline for a spell after cuffing a pitch invader. given cantona's already poor disciplinary record  he may well be facing a lengthy suspension just when manchester united need him most.  gifted footballer though he is  the frenchman has again demonstrated the fatal flaw in his temperament which eventually saw him quit league football in france after a series of run-ins with the authorities.  since joining manchester united from leeds he has proved inspirational in the winning of two championships as well as last season's league and fa cup double  but the devil in his make-up has never really gone away.  in last season's european cup he was shown the red card at the end of the game against galatasaray in istanbul for calling the referee a cheat  having already punched the turkish team's reserve goalkeeper as he sat on the bench.  last march he was shown two red cards in four days  at swindon and arsenal  and he began this season under suspension having been dismissed at ibrox.  last night  on a heavy pitch which cut up badly and with cole still ill-attuned to his new surroundings  manchester united needed cantona at his best  not his insufferable worst. after all  two seasons ago an outstanding goal from the frenchman against palace at selhurst had set united up for the title.  last night their passing did not improve until the few minutes allowed in the second half before all hell broke loose. palace had created the clearer scoring chances up to that point  but within six minutes of cantona's explosion may headed sharpe's cross past martyn to score his first league goal for united since arriving from blackburn.  'strange: all the fuss seemed to affect us more than them ' said palace's manager alan smith. ten-man united did reorganise themselves well and as sharpe hit the bar they seemed bound for the top of the premiership once more.  then may's slowness let in salako  whose shot was blocked  and amid a tumble of bodies southgate's cool shot brought the scores level.  crystal palace: martyn patterson  shaw  coleman  gordon  southgate  pitcher  newman  salako  dowie (preece  75min)  armstrong.  manchester united: schmeichel keane  may  pallister  irwin  giggs  mcclair  ince  sharpe  (kanchelskis  82)  cantona  cole.
sport,bbc,2005,ban on hunting comes into force  fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in england and wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight. the law faces a stiff test this weekend  with the countryside alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. chief police officers spokesman nigel yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. he said police would challenge the 'one or two isolated hunts' which are threatening to break the law. the attorney general  lord goldsmith  has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. he said he will consult the director of public prosecutions and the police 'in the near future' to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. he has rejected a 'blanket policy' of not enforcing the ban until the house of lords has considered its legality. anti-hunting activists are celebrating the introduction of the ban. hounds can be used to follow a scent and to flush out a fox and foxes can still be shot  or killed by birds of prey  after being tracked by a pair of hounds.
sport,bbc,2005,england win the ashes  england have beaten australia in the ashes series for the first time since 1987 after a draw in the final test at the oval. kevin pietersen hit 158 and ashley giles 59 before england were bowled out for 335 with a final series result of 2-1  snuffing out australian hopes of victory.  australia batted for just four balls before bad light intervened  and a draw was eventually declared by the umpires.  the result brings to an end a series many have dubbed the 'best ever'.  the queen and prime minister tony blair led the tributes to captain michael vaughan and his victorious team after the match.  there will be a victory parade tomorrow - but the champagne flowed as soon as vaughan lifted the tiny brown ashes urn aloft and the team was were showered in ticker tape and streamers.  the players then completed a victory lap of the oval pitch to salute the 23 000-strong crowd that had roared them on all day.  fans had spread onto the roofs and balconies of houses around the south london ground  and also celebrated in style  as did the country at large.  read more of this story on bbc news
sport,other,2005,julhino  the brazilian footballer julinho  who has died after a heart attack aged 73  was an outside-right of tremendous pace  power and skill  and scorer of a spectacular goal against hungary in the 1954 world cup in switzerland. a year later  he moved to florence  and a major role in fiorentina's first conquest of the italian championship; he played 31 of the 34 games  scoring half a dozen goals and creating many more.  solidly built  julinho was born in sao paolo  though it was with the relatively modest potuguesa des desportes club that he first emerged. one of six children of a grocery proprietor  he began playing football in the streets  and  because of fatherly disapproval  joined the local boys' team  juvenil palmeiras. by 16  he was top scorer - with 18 goals - in a team sponsored by the textile union.  julinho joined the juventus club of sao paolo in 1950  but after six months - and for some £25 000 - moved to portuguesa  where  at outside-right  he was an instant success. the following year  he toured europe  scoring seven times. he went on to win medals for the sao paolo  brazilian and south american championships. most notably  he was presented with a gold medal as the only major brazilian player who  for three seasons  had not been cautioned by a referee.  with a portugese father and italian grandfather  it was inevitable that he would draw the attention of european clubs. internazionale  of milan  approached him in 1950  but he turned them down following the birth of his son.  he played all three games for brazil in the 1954 world cup  scoring in their opening 5-0 win against mexico  but it was his goal against hungary  in berne  that was truly memorable. under driving rain in the second half  as violence raged  hungary were leading 'when julinho ' in the words of one observer  'after a magnificent swirling dribble at fantastic speed  shot a thunderbolt past grosics to make it 2-3'. the hungarians eventually won 4-2; brazil were out  and julinho  by then in italy  was not chosen for the 1958 world cup. in all he played 31 games for his country  scoring 13 goals.  he returned to brazil in 1959  and was promptly picked to play against england in rio. this was bad luck for blackpool's jimmy armfield  who was whimsically awarded his first cap at left-back - on his wrong foot. julinho ran him ragged  scoring the first brazilian goal in a 2-0 victory. on the field  he cut a withdrawn  implacable  almost statuesque figure.
sport,other,2005,sir bobby reopens the family feud  the feud between britain's most famous footballing brothers was reopened yesterday when sir bobby charlton broke his silence about years of rancour with his brother jack  accusing his 1966 world cup team-mate of making 'absolutely disgraceful' statements about his wife.  sir bobby  who is promoting his autobiography published next month  spoke for the first time about the rift between his wife and his late mother and admitted that he now rarely sees jack  even at christmas.  ad jack yesterday expressed surprise at bobby for reopening the wounds  but declined to comment further. the charlton siblings were rivals in club football - bobby at manchester united  jack at leeds united - but played together in england's victory over west germany in the world cup final. their falling out has cast a shadow over the family's unique achievement and reunions of the 'boys of 66'.  in an emotional interview  bobby  69  told how relations broke down between his wife norma and his mother cissie. 'my wife is a very strong character and does not suffer fools gladly ' he told the times. 'i am not suggesting my mother was a fool. there was a clash and it just never went away really.'  he said norma tried to make peace with her mother-in-law but in vain  forcing him to choose. 'we stopped seeing each other. at the end of the day you have to have your priorities and mine was my wife. i suppose if i'd made a major effort  maybe i could have changed things. but it wouldn't have changed anything at all. it's not abnormal. people say  'well  that happened to me'.'  the strife was laid bare in 1996 when jack publicly accused bobby of failing to visit their mother before her death  leaving her heartbroken. bobby responded: '[jack] came out in the newspapers saying things about my wife that were absolutely disgraceful. nonsense. ask anybody that ever met my wife: 'hoity-toity' is not a word they'd use. my brother made a big mistake. i don't understand why he did it. he couldn't possibly have known her and said what he said. i was astonished.'  he confronted jack at the first opportunity  but jack refused to back down. 'i didn't want him to do anything  i wanted him to explain.' but he could not  sir bobby said.  'i made my mind up that i would protect my wife whatever happens and that's the way i saw it. i mean  maybe i should have gone to see my mother but maybe  maybe...' asked if he would have liked a reconciliation with his mother  he replied: 'i wouldn't have looked for it and i wouldn't have expected it.'  sir bobby  a 2012 olympics ambassador and director of manchester united  revealed that he hardly sees his brother and that the arrival of grandchildren failed to save their relationship. 'i don't think anybody should feel sad about it. he's a big lad  i'm a big lad and you move on. i'm not going to ruin the rest of my life worrying about my brother and i've no doubt he's the same. if we see each other we'll say hello. i'm sorry it's happened  but life goes on.'  when contacted by the observer for a response yesterday  jack remained silent for several seconds.  finally  he said: 'i don't want to get involved in all of this. i've been through it all before and i don't want to get involved. i was surprised that he's doing a book and it's all appeared in the book and it's all been written before and i've nothing to say about it at all.'  jack  72  a former republic of ireland manager  said: 'i'm not going to answer questions  forget it  that's it.' jack charlton's eldest son  john  who works for a sports club  said: 'i know jack's a little bit disappointed and feels bobby doesn't need to write that kind of stuff. i think it's like anything  you've got to know the full story.  'it's all about lots of half-truths. you can make anything read how you want it to read and ... the way it appears is not necessarily the way that it was. i know what went on and what's been said and what's happened over the years.'  as 2022 begins  there’s a new year resolution we’d like you to consider. we’d like to invite you to join more than 1.5 million people in 180 countries who have taken the step to support us financially – keeping us open to all  and fiercely independent.  in 2021  this support sustained investigative work into offshore wealth  spyware  sexual harassment  labour abuse  environmental plunder  crony coronavirus contracts  and big tech. it enabled diligent  fact-checked  authoritative journalism to thrive in an era of falsehood  sensation  hype and breathtaking misinformation and misconception.  in 2022  we’ll be no less active  with a cluster of elections (france  brazil  the us to say the least)  economic pinch points  the next phase of the pandemic  the gathering climate emergency and the first ‘winter world cup’ to keep us busy.  with no shareholders or billionaire owner  we can set our own agenda and provide trustworthy journalism that’s free from commercial and political influence  offering a counterweight to the spread of misinformation. when it’s never mattered more  we can investigate and challenge without fear or favour.  unlike many others  guardian journalism is available for everyone to read  regardless of what they can afford to pay. we do this because we believe in information equality. while others commoditise information  we seek to democratise it. greater numbers of people can keep track of global events  understand their impact  and become inspired to take meaningful action.
sport,bbc,2020,super bowl 2022: how beleaguered bengals turned around their fortunes  after a season full of surprises it seems fitting that the nfl's championship game features a side that few fancied to get there. just two years ago the cincinnati bengals finished with the worst record in the league. last summer even the jacksonville jaguars had shorter odds for reaching super bowl 56. yet while the jaguars went on to become the league's worst team for a second straight season the bengals will play in the big game for the first time in 33 years. cincinnati face the los angeles rams on sunday looking to claim their first nfl title and complete their journey from whipping boys to 'world champions'. but how has the long-suffering franchise managed to turn its fortunes around so soon? american football has been the most popular sport in the us since the 1960s and the main reason is competitive parity. it's what the nfl prides itself on. in 55 years no team has won the super bowl more than six times and the last 22 seasons have seen 13 different champions. but two-time super bowl winner osi umenyiora says this season the 'parity was unprecedented'. fellow bbc pundit jason bell reckons it was 'the greatest in nfl history'. the regular season produced a record 35 walk-off wins - games won with a score on the final play. there were four more on an extraordinary weekend in the play-offs before cincinnati claimed another to deny the kansas city chiefs a third straight super bowl and continue their own cinderella story. 'you love competition and that's what the nfl delivered ' bell added. 'the teams are so equal. with so many match-ups we just didn't know what was going to happen.' the nfl tries to level the playing field by having a salary cap and distributing television revenue equally to the 32 teams while the nfl draft gives them the chance to make immediate improvements on the field. teams select from the nation's best college players with last season's worst team going first in each round and the champions last. with the first pick in 2020 cincinnati selected joe burrow. the quarterback was expected to go first having just won the national college championship and the heisman trophy for best college player. he also happens to be from ohio so the bengals are his closest team. with the fifth pick in 2021 they chose wide receiver ja'marr chase. then with the 149th they took evan mcpherson the only kicker to be selected in last year's draft. it's fair to say those selections have paid off for cincinnati and the nfl.
sport,bbc,2020,winter olympics: kamila valieva test puts russia & doping in spotlight again  those two words sound bad enough on their own.  russia. a case of suspected doping. announced at an olympics where the country is already banned for doping. a child involved.  could it sound any worse?  the revelation that 15-year-old figure skater kamila valieva failed a drugs test before beijing 2022 has put the games under a black cloud  swinging the spotlight away from sport and once again on a dark subject that simply will not go away.  there are now questions over timelines regarding the matter  a legal case under way  uncertainty over medals won - and that is without even considering the wider damage to the credibility of anti-doping measures and the welfare of a young athlete.  so  how have we got here and what happens next?  why are russians at the games - aren't they supposed to be banned? at tokyo 2020 and beijing 2022  russians have been allowed to compete under the flag of the russian olympic committee (roc) if they could prove they were untainted by the doping scandal that led to the country being banned from international sporting events.  an investigation into revelations that surfaced in 2014 found the country had operated a state-sponsored doping programme.  the roc delegation to beijing is the third biggest at the games  with 212 athletes.  russian athletes have won 11 medals here  but under the terms of their participation they do not hear their anthem  see their flag raised when they are on the podium and must not wear any russian flags on their clothing.  at the tokyo 2020 games  russian athletes faced backlash from fellow competitors who believed they should not be at the games because of the country's doping record.  after the revelation on friday of another russian failed test  much of the reaction on social media raised exactly this point.  first a state-sponsored doping scandal - now a child failing a drugs test the fact valieva is a child is what makes this failed drugs test particularly shocking.  'kamila valieva is a young girl and child prodigy  whose highly difficult performances and grace enchanted the whole world at only 15. a minor  depending on adults and she is not to blame here ' double olympic champion katarina witt wrote in an emotional facebook post.   'it is a shame  and the responsible adults should be banned from the sport forever.'  valieva tested positive for trimetazidine  which is used in the prevention of angina attacks  but is on the banned list because it is classed as a cardiac metabolic modulator and has been proven to improve physical efficiency.  former wada deputy director rob koehler said there were three organisations to blame for valieva's positive test - wada  the international olympic committee (ioc) and the court of arbitration for sport (cas).  'by not banning russia for four years  there was no need or desire for cultural change by russian authorities. by allowing russia a free pass these organisations have severely let down every single athlete in russia because it's business as usual ' he said.  'athletes in russia deserved a cultural change  they deserved the right to have the opportunity to compete clean. instead  wada  the ioc and cas favoured the power and influence of russian sport over clean sport.'  from 'flawless' to 'failed' in headlines valieva had arrived in beijing tipped for gold and had already made global headlines by becoming the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an olympics.  since making her senior debut last october she has set a series of world record for scores with highly technical but also aesthetically beautiful routines and was set to star for one of the sport's most dominant countries.  she announced herself on the olympic stage on monday in the team event with a short programme that was just shy of her own world record score  and in the free skate the following day she even landed not just the one  but two quadruple jumps.  commentators branded her performances 'flawless' and predicted she would be making many more headlines at these games.  not this sort though.  what happened in the russian doping scandal? in 2014  revelations of a doping scandal came to light  eventually leading to a report in 2016 finding that russia had operated a state-sponsored doping programme for four years across the 'vast majority' of summer and winter olympic sports.  that included tampering with tests at the 2014 sochi winter games  where as hosts they finished top of the medal table.  at the rio 2016 olympics  russians competed across a range of sports but track and field athletes were banned  while at the 2018 pyeongchang winter games  athletes with no record of doping were allowed to compete under the name olympic athlete from russia.  in 2019  russia were given a four-year ban from all major sporting events by wada after it declared russia's anti doping agency (rusada) non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators.  that ban was later reduced to two years by cas and is due to run out in december.  before beijing 2022  wada president witold banka warned russia it should not assume the sanctions would automatically be lifted when the suspension runs out in december  saying: 'at the end of the year we will need to say 'yes  rusada can be compliant'. it is not the end of this process. it is too early to say definitely that they are compliant.'  russia denies running a state-sponsored doping programme but has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules.  what happens next? the immediate issue is what happens with the valieva case itself - although there should be a resolution with that before she is due to compete on 15 february in the women's event.  the ioc and the international skating union have appealed to cas against the decision by rusada to lift the provisional suspension it had imposed when it learned of the positive test on tuesday.  rusada initially suspended valieva before she appealed against the decision.  there is also the issue of the medals for the figure skating team event  which are still to be handed out. the russians came first  but the second-placed united states will be wondering if they are about to get a medal upgrade.  the russian olympic committee said it would 'take comprehensive measures in order to protect the rights and interests of the members of the roc team and to preserve the honestly won olympic gold medal'.  there are also question marks over why it took so long to get the result of her test - she took the test on 25 december and the result was only given on 8 february after being processed in a wada-accredited stockholm lab.  'it is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks  and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event ' united states anti-doping agency head travis tygart said.  beyond these games though  there are broader questions that will need answering  not least what exactly needs to happens to ensure the words 'russia' and 'doping' stop coming up in the same sentence.
sport,other,2020,‘clean and innocent’: valieva’s coach breaks silence with cas to decide teen’s fate  the brilliant 15-year-old skater kamila valieva  who has been at the epicentre of a doping and media storm at these winter olympics  will learn her fate from the court of arbitration for sport (cas) on monday.  the russian looked calm and focused at practice on saturday  producing a flawless rendition of her short programme before coming off the ice to the soundtrack of sia’s i’m unstoppable.  however  valieva’s dreams of competing in the individual event on tuesday will come to an abrupt halt if cas decides to uphold her doping suspension  which followed a positive test when trimetazidine was found in a urine sample collected by russian authorities on christmas day. it will meet via video conference on sunday evening in beijing before informing all parties of its decision on monday afternoon.  on saturday valieva’s controversial coach  eteri tutberidze  insisted that her skater was clean but accepted that the situation was “very controversial and difficult”.  “i want to say that i am absolutely sure that kamila is innocent and clean ” she said. “for us  this is not a theorem  but an axiom  it does not need to be proved. we are with our athletes  in trouble and in joy  to the end.”  the latest development follows an extraordinary week that began on monday when valieva captured the hearts of the world when she became the first female skater to perform a quad at the games as the russian olympic committee (roc) won a brilliant team gold.  a day later  however  the russian anti-doping agency imposed a provisional suspension on valieva when a swedish laboratory reported a positive test before lifting it on wednesday on appeal.  the international olympic committee (ioc)  international skating union (isu) and the world anti-doping agency (wada) have asked cas to reinstate the suspension but valieva has been able to train in the meantime.  on saturday she made a point of hugging tutberidze during practice on saturday before walking through the mixed zone  accompanied by two burly minders. there was even a smile when she received shouts of encouragement from the russian media.  however  in russia the focus has intensified on tutberidze  who is known for her uncompromising methods. after valieva’s positive test for trimetazidine  a drug usually used to treat angina  the hashtag #позортутберидзе – “shame on you  tutberidze” – has been trending on twitter. but speaking to russian station channel one  tutberidze directed her focus on why it had taken so long for valieva’s positive test to emerge  given it was conducted on christmas day but only reported by a swedish laboratory on 8 february. an outbreak of covid at the lab in january is said to be the cause  however tutberidze didn’t sound convinced.  “it is very unclear why an athlete with a dubious doping test on december 25 was admitted to the olympic games ” she said. “either this is a fatal coincidence  or this is a very competent plan. i really hope that our leaders will not abandon us  defend our rights and prove our innocence.”  earlier the ioc said it would welcome an anti-doping investigation into valieva’s “entourage” after the 15-year-old russian’s positive drugs test.  “entourage has been overlooked in the past ” ioc spokesman mark adams told a news conference on saturday. “the ioc  as ever  would welcome investigation into the entourage in all cases where it’s relevant. in this case  as in all cases  we would welcome a strong line from the world anti-doping agency on that.” that approach was backed by double olympic figure skating champion katarina witt  who said valieva was not to blame for her positive drugs test.  “this scandal is a dramatic cut to her young and promising career and i sincerely hope that enough people are by her side and protect her so that she doesn’t break ” she said.  “kamila has learned her quadruple jumps with infinite diligence and courage. no doping would have helped her to land these! and especially not with their artistic radiation! if anything  the adults responsible should be locked up for sports forever!”  however  dick pound  a long-standing member of the ioc  said that russia’s latest doping infraction - which follows on from state-sponsored doping at the 2014 sochi games and manipulating testing data at a moscow lab - suggested it was time russia took an olympic ‘timeout’.  “at a certain point if they are absolutely incorrigible you end up with the position of taking a country timeout ” said pound. “we could say we can help you. you’ve got a problem. we can concentrate on it. take a time out for one or two  or three olympic games until you get this under control.”
sport,other,2020,ireland look to joey carbery to step up in finely poised match with france  johnny sexton’s injury may tilt odds slightly towards france  but andy farrell’s side sound like they know how they want to win. you could hear this match between ireland and france coming way back in the autumn. the anticipation has been building like a drum fill since the two teams beat new zealand on back-to-back saturdays last november.  right now  the world rankings will tell you that ireland are the best team in europe. the french  who were  after all  the last team to beat ireland when they won 15-13 in dublin last year  believe differently. they are playing to settle that  the shot at the grand slam  and something more  too. the winner will step forward full of confidence that they can beat the best teams in the biggest games  with the ringing conviction that they are the top team. the loser will have to live with the knowledge that they came up short when it counted most  and deal with the doubt that follows a step backwards. at the start of the week  you could have made a case that the irish were just about favourites  even though they are going away from home. they had played pitilessly well against wales last saturday  while france had had a harder time getting past italy a day later.  and then the news broke that johnny sexton had strained a hamstring and would miss this game. in a match as finely poised as this  that was enough  all of a sudden  to tilt the balance back the other way. “that’s sport ” said ireland’s head coach  andy farrell.  his team had trained for this  rehearsed it in practice  swapping sexton and his replacement joey carbery in and out for the last three weeks. the game’s never just about one man  farrell said  and he’s right. his ireland team have grown over the last year  winning nine games on the bounce  and don’t depend on sexton like they used to. but it’s true  too  that some players are easier to do without than others  and sexton  the man who won the game with a 45-metre drop-goal the last time ireland won in paris  is about the last one farrell would want to lose.  for ireland  then  the game has become a different sort of test. the question in front of them now is how they’ll go without their captain and playmaker  and whether carbery  who has played so well off the bench since he made his debut in 2016  is the man to take over when sexton has finally gone for good. it’s an issue they have been worrying about on and off for the last few years. it even came up in the last world cup  when sexton was forced out of ireland’s pool match against japan with a thigh injury. on that occasion  farrell’s predecessor joe schmidt picked jack carty to start  and put carbery on the bench. ireland lost 19-12. this time  farrell has them the other way round. even so  the irish have been talking a good game. the players and coaches have sounded calm and confident all week. “we’re very clear on where we’re sitting at the moment  how we’ve developed our game  how we’re playing the game ” says the scrum coach john fogarty. “we’ve played france twice in the last two years  when we came here last time out we didn’t feel as ready as we do now.” they sound like a team who know exactly how they want to win.  “there’s going to be times when we have to muscle up  but in general we want to be on our feet  we don’t want to be on the ground  and we don’t want to be clustered in any parts of the field. hopefully we can spend more time playing the game than in an arm-wrestle.” the question is how well that plan holds up when the french bring the hammer down on it. their head coach  fabien galthié  has brought the burly françois cros into the back row to bolster his monumental pack  and loaded his bench with six forwards too. they’ll look to soften ireland up  and then strike. the chances are there will be a moment in there  somewhere  when it’s all ireland can do to stay in the game. farrell knows it  and has tried to prepare his team for it.  “there’s no doubt that france are going to have a purple patch  it’s an absolute given ” farrell says  “how we get back on task is going to be key for both sides  no doubt about that.”  if they can hold on through that stretch  then the game may come down to the replacements. it’s a sign of just how strong this ireland squad is that they have five british and irish lions on the bench. if the match is still in the balance at that point  it might be the young french side who start to feel the pressure. as galthié put it  in his own inimitable way  “we are touching the summit of european rugby  the sublime side of the european game.” which  if you need the translation  is his way of saying it’s going to be a hell of a match.
tech,bbc,1990,hubble telescope takes off for space  the american space agency nasa has successfully launched the space shuttle discovery from cape canaveral in florida on its historic mission to carry the hubble space telescope into orbit 380 miles (611.5 km) above the earth. the telescope will operate from high above the atmosphere  thus avoiding the interference which limits ground-based telescopes.  it will be able to see up to the edge of the known universe  taking images of objects and events which happened up to 14 billion years ago.  the telescope  the size of a railway carriage  has taken 20 years to build  at a cost of $1.55 billion.  it has been dogged by technical hitches  huge budget over-runs and other delays.  seven years late  its launch is seven years overdue  held up by problems in the space shuttle program  including the explosion of the challenger shuttle in 1986.  the problems continued even once it was safely in space  as the british-made solar panel arrays which provide power for the six separate instruments on board malfunctioned.  however  scientists said they were expecting it to be difficult.  'deploying the solar panels is technically more challenging than the launch of a shuttle one more time ' said nasa scientist stephen maran.  the fault was resolved  and now the telescope faces six months of testing before becoming fully operational.  test image  nasa hopes to release the first test image - of an open star cluster known as ngc 3532 - in about a week.  hubble's main instrument is a finely-polished mirror 94 inches (240 cm) across.  there are also two cameras - one which can achieve image resolutions 10 times greater than that of even the largest earth-based telescope  and a second which can detect an object 50 times fainter than anything visible from earth.  'we are going to have the ability to observe the most distant objects  among the earliest in the universe  and thus probe the secrets of creation ' said nasa's chief scientist  leonard fisk.  the telescope will be controlled by the specially-created space telescope science institute at baltimore.  it's thought hubble's images will provoke a drastic revision of the shapes  sizes and content of galaxies already identified by ground-based telescopes.  it is also likely to find new stars and phenomena  and astronomers suggest the telescope provides the best chance yet of working out the true age of the universe.

tech,other,1990,smart homes wave of the '90s  when a bad dream awakens 7-year-old westin lord and he heads downstairs to his mother and father's bedroom  his house knows to light the way for him.  as soon as his feet touch the floor  a sensor reports the motion to the computerized brains of the home. given the hour of the night  the computer responds to the sensor's message by switching on a series of lights that illuminate only the hallway and winding staircase.  imbued with computer intelligence  the silver spring home in the burnt mills neighborhood knows plenty of other tricks to make the lords' lives easier. in fact  it is ready to learn a lot more.  not only did obstetrician c. douglas lord  50  and his wife diane  35  choose to automate as much of their newly built  12 500-square-foot home as is now possible  they also ordered an extra six miles of wiring installed. the walls also conceal a household-wide skeleton of pipes that may some day facilitate the addition of fiber-optic cables or any other new wiring for distributing data throughout the house.  'we wanted to do everything we could to be ready for the future  but be able to enjoy {what is available} now ' douglas lord said.  the lords' foresight is well placed  according to home automation officials  who say that their industry is on the verge of breakthroughs destined to raise the 'intelligence' of the average american home  not just expensive homes like the lords'.  delaware home builder leon n. weiner  a top official of smart house l.p.  which is working to develop electronic household systems  predicts the 1990s will go down in history as the 'decade of home automation.'  some luxury homes already contain expensive versions of what is expected to become a mass-market product later in this decade. custom commands systems  a college park-based firm that considers itself the ferrari of the home automation installation business  creates systems that typically start at $60 000.  events over the next 24 months  however  could supply the final push needed to make the complete automation of average homes  both new and existing  a reality.  what the home automation community is waiting for is an industry standard that would tell builders and remodelers how to wire homes for total automation.  the standard also would provide specifications needed by manufacturers of consumer electronic products and household appliances to tie their wares into an automated home. that standard would enable the security  heating  cooling  lighting  telephone  audio and video systems in a house to work together in new ways.  the lack of a standard  said hank levine  custom command's executive vice president  creates a situation similar to 'buying a cd player and then having to build a custom interface so you can plug it into your receiver and it will work. virtually no cd players would sell because they would cost $10 000.'  for the moment  though  a contest is underway to determine whatthe home automation community is waiting for an industry standard. the standard will be  said tricia parks  a residential electronics analyst in dallas. 'for things to take off ' parks said  'one of these {would-be standards} needs to happen.'  one contender is known as the consumer electronic bus (cebus) standard. it is the brainchild of the electronic industries association and completion of a first portion of the standard is due by year's end. adding a cebus wiring system to a 2 500-square-foot home will probably cost no more than $500 to $700 plus whatever cebus-compatible appliances the owner chooses  parks said.  the cebus specifications will eventually encompass all of the methods of sending messages throughout an intelligent home  including transmissions using the existing power lines  telephone wires  cable-tv circuits  radio signals  infrared waves and fiber-optic networks.  a private consortium backed by the home-building community also hopes to set the industry norm when its smart house technology hits the streets.  the first commercially available 'smart-ready' houses in the country will be on sale here in april  with 'fully smart' houses ready for occupancy in october.  an entry-level smart house package will come in at a 'highly competitive' $7 500  said weiner  the partnership's chief executive officer.  several independent companies are vying to set a de facto standard in much the same way international business machines corp. did for computers and american telephone & telegraph co. did for telephones. the 'most talked about' aspirant  parks said  is the los gatos  calif.-based echelon. on dec. 5  the firm is expected to announce its technical proposal for distributing intelligence through a home.  if nothing else  echelon's leadership commands industry attention. president ken oshman was a founder of the once-high-flying telephone equipment company rolm corp.  and vice chairman mike markkula helped start apple computer inc.  if any of these efforts or a few other dark horses fail to prevail  then parks predicts that europe will 'take the opening' with the esprit system currently under development for use in houses there.  parks said she does not believe the japanese are looking to export their home automation standard  but they are poised to move in with an array of products once the standard question is settled in the united states.  once a standard emerges in the united states  industry officials say  the new technology will catch on so quickly that homes built up until that point will become obsolete if they aren't modified.
tech,other,1990,the comeback of japanese software entrepreneur kay nishi  the dark day of bankruptcy loomed for kay nishi  japan's most extraordinary entrepreneur. last summer  his company - ascii corporation - was on the verge of collapse under a mountain of debt. then  at the eleventh hour  ascii (after the standard code for text) was rescued by a group of six banks led by the powerful industrial bank of japan (ibj)  egged-on by the ministry of international trade and industry (miti). yashushi kajiwara  ibj's managing director at the time  commented  'nishi-san's talent is important for japan - his firm cannot be allowed to go under.'  the idea that keeping a particular individual's firm solvent should be in the national interest may sound odd. but kazuhiko nishi is no ordinary entrepreneur. his vision is valued throughout japan's computer industry  which is currently struggling to cope with recession and rapid changes in technology. it was out of appreciation for this vision that the combined corporate forces of japan stepped in to keep ascii afloat.  part i: the fall  kazuhiko (kay) nishi was born 37 years ago in the southern japanese port city of kobe. a precocious child  he might well have gone into the family business of running a private school. but while a student at tokyo's elite waseda university  nishi fell in love - with personal computers.  nishi dropped out of college - a most un-japanese thing to do  especially from a top school like waseda - to begin publishing a pc magazine called i/o. his hobby led  in 1978  to the foundation of ascii corporation. publishing computer and video game magazines remains one of ascii's core businesses  accounting for about us$140 million of the company's 1992 sales of us$350 million.  having founded a company  kay nishi promptly caught a plane for the us. there  he met another bespectacled 22-year-old college drop-out who was also obsessed with pcs. his name: bill gates. the nerdlings hit it off immediately and ascii soon after became microsoft's japanese agent.  'for a guy from japan  kay's more like me than probably anybody i've ever met ' gates would subsequently tell a reporter from the wall street journal. the comparison does nishi a disservice. the soft-spoken nishi has none of gates's aggressive  bullying manner. rather  he is a courteous man who persuades via boyish enthusiasm and considerable charm.  alike or not  the bond between the whiz kids from either side of the pacific was to have at least one momentous consequence. nishi was at microsoft when an invitation arrived from ibm to provide an operating system for a new personal computer. his enthusiasm for the project persuaded gates to enter a bid. 'if i hadn't been there ' nishi says  'ms- dos would never have happened.'  back home  nishi talked nec into building japan's first indigenous personal computer  the pc 8001  a machine that went on to become the de facto personal computer standard in that country. it was nishi too who dreamed up the radio shack model 100 - an early laptop computer much used by journalists and other globe-trotting vagrants. nishi's relationship with gates helped ascii grow big. but as microsoft's japanese sales expanded  gates became increasingly impatient with nishi's unorthodox approach to business. the last straw came when the flamboyant nishi poured $1 million into a publicity stunt involving a life-size model of a brontosaurus. this was parked outside a major tokyo railway station to promote msx  a new pc format jointly developed by the two companies for the japanese market.  the promotion was a success - 'everybody remembers that dinosaur ' chuckles nishi - but chairman bill missed the joke. the partnership was formally dissolved in 1986  when microsoft set up its own japanese software subsidiary.  speculation that ascii would not survive the split with microsoft was soon dispelled by ascii's own rapid growth as a software-publishing powerhouse. in 1989  ascii became the first japanese software firm to go public on tokyo's over-the-counter stock market.  the japanese requirements for taking a company public are stiff and discouraging. before qualifying for listing on the tokyo stock exchange  a company must first be able to demonstrate annual sales of around us$50 million and profits of us$5 million. in the us  by contrast  a company can be losing money and still go public. going public in japan made nishi a multi-millionaire in the process.  personally extravagant - an oft-told tale describes him walking into a los angeles record store and ordering one of every laser disc in stock  some 2 000 titles in total - nishi led ascii into a slew of new businesses. he paid us$11 million for the japanese subsidiary of vestron  a movie distributor  and another us$7.5 million for a stake in a us-based movie production house. other investments included a travel agency and a helicopter rental outfit (choppers have become nishi's preferred mode of travel in over-congested japan).  in the us  nishi gained a reputation as a friend to needy start-ups. it was he who provided crucial seed capital for pc chip-set makers chips & technologies  sparking his fascination with semi-conductors that continues to this day. us semiconductor firms that ascii helped bankroll include crosspoint solutions (us$20 million)  and nexgen microsystems (us$20 million).  nishi's interest in start-ups was not confined to software and semiconductors. under his direction  ascii's venture capital portfolio ballooned to 25 investments in total  worth around us$1 billion  and running the gamut of the electronics industry.  some of these stakes were acquired more or less on the spur of the moment. a participant at one meeting designed to raise several million dollars for a us computer start-up recalls how nishi  growing impatient as other investors hesitated  offered to put up the whole amount himself.  but investment on this epic scale could not go on forever  especially not under japan's worsening economic conditions. by mid 1992  ascii was in hock to the tune of us$320 million  more than the company's usual annual sales. its share price plummeted from a peak of us$175 to just over us$5. unable to borrow any more on the bond market  nishi was forced to seek succor from japanese banks.  most popular north korea on a map glitches with a 404 error code. security north korea hacked him. so he took down its internet  andy greenberg  mechanic's hand holding a screwdriver over the engine bay of a car business a fight over the right to repair cars turns ugly  aarian marshall  paper airplanes flying around the surface of the earth backchannel how telegram became the anti-facebook  darren loucaides  woolly mammoth statute science you're (maybe) gonna need a patent for that woolly mammoth  matt reynolds  part ii: the rise  today  bloodied but unbowed  kay nishi is back from the brink. having a senior executive from the industrial bank of japan on board seems to have reassured investors  and ascii's stock has bounced back to us$27 and is still (at this writing) rising. on march 31  1993 the company repaid us$100 million of its debt. nishi says that now  all he has to do is make more profit  a task 'which is easy ' he confides.  in keeping with the austere spirit of the times  ascii has imposed a hiring freeze and is moving its headquarters from tokyo's plush aoyama district (the only place in japan where european automobiles outnumber toyotas) to cheaper premises in another part of the city. the company has regrouped to focus on its four core businesses: publishing  personal software (including video games)  business software  and semiconductors. and even within those areas  ascii is aiming for a higher hit rate  exploiting proven strengths rather than attempting to develop new ones.  typically  the irrepressible nishi sees limited resources and tight financial discipline as a virtue. 'it's a more effective way of running the business ' he comments. 'after spending a lot of money  i learned that the amount of spending is not proportional to the amount of satisfaction.'  the realization extends to his personal spending habits. the former owner of rolls-royces  bentleys  and aston martins now professes himself bored with expensive luxury cars. these days  nishi says he is happy with the most advanced consumer models  like the latest honda. he still buys a new car each season  and admits  'it's fun to see what kind of intelligence the makers put into them.'  one thing that has not changed is nishi's determination to continue investing in hot new technologies. for example  he is currently preoccupied with producing chip sets and compression algorithms for digital high- definition video and audio. his vehicle is a tokyo-based start-up called graphic technology  in which ascii is the largest investor.  thus far  gt has been successful selling its codes to nippon telegraph and telephone for use in the giant firm's video-conferencing systems. the company is about to branch out into audio and video via an mpeg-based encoder for a compact-disc-based karaoke machine. this will be capable of storing ten times as much music as a regular (analog) karaoke laser disc  as well as a full-motion video accompaniment. a somewhat prosaic product perhaps  but a stepping stone on the way to what nishi predicts will be 'the next big hit' for the consumer electronics industry. these will be digital video discs that can store two hours of hdtv-quality programming on a 5-inch plastic platter.  participation in the compression-chip-set market is useful for ascii strategically  he says  'because it really helps us understand to what extent our dream of a digital future is going to come true.'  that dream extends well beyond digital video discs  which nishi reckons should take off (if enabling technology such as green lasers permit) around 1995. it also encompasses digital hdtv recorders (by the year 2000  he suggests)  personalized audio - in which the computer saves your choice of music  news  or whatever out of hundreds of audio channels (by 2005) - and  ultimately  personalized tv and video (by 2010).  involved in the compression start-ups with ascii are some of japan's largest companies  including hitachi  jvc  and ntt. such firms tend to use ascii 'like an experimental mouse ' nishi says  because 'we're always doing something new.' nishi is a great believer in the invigorating powers of the novel: 'new things ' he says  'are like brain athletics.' to keep his own gray matter in good shape  for the past three years he has taught a course in media system engineering at the tokyo institute of technology.  'nicholas negroponte (director of the mit media lab and wired columnist) encouraged me to do it ' he explains  adding that 'teaching students gives you perspective... it has been a very important experience for me.' like so many other things in nishi's remarkable career  it has also been 'really fun.
tech,bbc,2005,web icon set to be discontinued  the browser that helped kick-start the commercial web is to cease development because of lack of users. netscape navigator  now owned by aol  will no longer be supported after 1 february 2008  the company has said. in the mid-1990s the browser was used by more than 90% of the web population  but numbers have slipped to just 0.6%. in particular  the browser has faced competition from microsoft's internet explorer (ie)  which is now used by nearly 80% of all web users. 'while internal groups within aol have invested a great deal of time and energy in attempting to revive netscape navigator  these efforts have not been successful in gaining market share from microsoft's internet explorer ' said tom drapeau on the company's blog. browser wars netscape was developed by marc andreessen  co-author of mosaic  the first popular web browser. mosaic was written while mr andreessen was a student at the national center for supercomputing applications at the university of illinois in 1992. firefox logo firefox was created by many of the navigator developers after graduation he set up netscape communications corporation and began development of the navigator browser. the first version was released in 1994. it was quickly a success and dominated the browser market in the mid-1990s. but other companies followed its success  notably microsoft  which bundled its explorer software with its operating systems. this culminated in a highly-publicised legal battle  which saw microsoft accused of anti-competitive behaviour. although the settlement saw netscape gain many concessions from microsoft including the ability to exploit ie code  it has been unable to gain back its market share. the demise of navigator was compounded in 2003 when aol  which bought netscape in 1998  made redundant most of the staff working on new versions of the browser. many of the staff moved to the mozilla foundation which develops the popular firefox browser. this browser has a 16% share of the browser market. fade away although a core team has continued to work on the secure browser - it is currently on version nine - aol has decided to finally pull the plug. 'after 1 february  there will be no more active product support for navigator nine  or any previous netscape navigator browser ' wrote mr drapeau. 'we feel it's the right time to end development of netscape branded browsers  hand the reins fully to mozilla and encourage netscape users to adopt firefox ' he said. users of the browser will no longer receive security or software updates after the date. old versions of the browser will still be available for download  but will no longer be supported. microsoft is expected to launch a new version of ie in 2008  whilst the third version of firefox is currently available as a beta  or test version.
tech,bbc,2005,gates hails age of digital senses  the way people interact with computers is going to dramatically change in the next five years  microsoft chief bill gates has told bbc news. he predicted that the keyboard and mouse would gradually give way to more intuitive and natural technologies.  in particular  he said  touch  vision and speech interfaces would become increasingly important.  mr gates made his comments whilst answering questions from bbc news website readers. 'this whole idea of what i call natural user interface is really redefining the experience ' he said.  'we're adding the ability to touch and directly manipulate  we're adding vision so the computer can see what you're doing  we're adding the pen  we're adding speech ' he told bbc news.  during the interview mr gates showed off the microsoft surface computer  a large table like machine with a multi-touch interface.  'i'll be brave  in five years we'll have many tens of million of people sitting browsing their photos  browsing their music  organising their lives using this type of touch interface ' he said.  mr gates expanded on this theme of natural interfaces during the ces keynote speech he made on the first day of the hi-tech fair.  citing the success of the iphone and the controller for the nintendo wii game console  mr gates said such interfaces were a big hit with consumers.  vista versions  although microsoft windows has become the most widely used operating system in the world  mr gates admitted  in answer to readers questions  that he had not always got things right.  'people thought we were late with the [web] browser ' he admitted.  in addition  he said  search was an area where people thought that microsoft had not fulfilled expectations.  'google has done a good job ' he said. 'we expect to surprise people that we can match and even do better there - people should wait and see.' mr gates also answered questions about windows vista  the firm's often-criticised operating system  launched last year.  'i'm very proud of vista ' he said. 'like all of the products we ship  we hear how we could do this differently or that differently.'  he said the firm had received 'lots of feedback' on the software.  'we do downloads and improvements all of the time and of course there'll be a major new version coming along ' he said.  microsoft has just announced that it has sold 100 million licences for the operating system.  during the questions and answer session he also revealed his own computer habits.  'there are a lot of pcs in my house - over 10 ' he said.  in particular  he said  he used a tablet pc  a notebook computer that is operated with a digital stylus.  however  he said  he does not use his competitor's products.  'there are no macs in my house ' he admitted.
tech,other,2005,could competitive gaming finally be entering the mainstream?  i've never bought into the 'gaming is a sport' thing. yes gaming needs decent reflexes and skills but sitting on your arse playing counter-strike never struck me us up there with running a marathon or scoring the winning goal against pompey when it comes to sporting achievements. i could be wrong though. let's face it darts and snooker are hardly tests of physical endurance. and i have no doubt that i'd get thrashed at counter-strike  warcraft iii and all the other aging pc games normally played competitively. sensible world of soccer is a different story mind. anyway  maybe  just maybe  there is something to this sports gaming thing. today the uk esports association (ukesa) – no  me neither  although they are apparently the official governing body for competitive gaming in the uk - launched the first official uk videogaming tournament. interestingly consoles games are finally included. historically these tournaments have tended to be pc only and despite all the arguments – and i have a lot of time for pc gaming – watching or playing games on your pc will never be sexy to anyone outside the hardcore. console gaming though has a chance of attracting a wider audience – heck  even the wii is included. see for yourself…
tech,other,2005,copyleft newspapers: the guardian's open platform  and why it matters  in a move to merge copyleft ideals with a repository of 1 million articles from the last decade of publishing  the guardian wants to give web site and application developers everything it has written since 1999  for free. but there's a catch: developers have to agree to run advertisements alongside their creations  and the guardian dictates exactly what those ads are -- because it makes money from each one.  it's a free product called open platform  incorporating a content api and a collection of data sets called the data store. it delivers the site's massive collection of articles and blogs to developers  and therefore applications  which request them. articles are appropriately tagged to identify their content -- 'middlesex'  'obama inauguration'  'pensioner uprising of 2015' -- and made available in xml  atom or json formats. an iphone app  for example  could deliver information about whichever town you're standing in  by plucking articles about that town from the guardian's database. just make sure there's room for an ad.  why is the guardian doing this? as a news web site covering topics from technology to fashion  music to culture  it's built up quite the repository of information. years of editorial copy just sitting in a dark corner of the web site  like a discarded x-factor runner-up  just waiting for some entrepreneurial forward-thinker to pipe up and drag it back into the public eye.  and the public eye -- or 'eyeballs' as the media sales industry so delicately calls them -- is exactly what the guardian wants. every application using its content is promoting the newspaper's name and brand  while simultaneously growing the guardian's ad network  commercial reach and  ultimately  its revenue.  the new york times has been doing something similar for a month or so. its version is called the article search api and lets developers search  scrape and republish new york times articles  images and other data in any app they choose to create. the difference is that while the guardian allows for commercial uses of its api  the new york times does not  and so does not force the inclusion of its advertisements.  the small print  there are some other major restrictions to open platform. content pulled from the database cannot be saved for offline use for more than 24 hours  so the creation of pseudo-encyclopaedic applications  as suggested by one user  would currently be impossible. also  applications cannot ask for information from the guardian more than 5 000 times per day (the new york times also imposes this same limit)  and all content pulled into an app must link back to the original guardian article.  despite fairly tight restrictions and unashamed commercial intent  we applaud what the guardian is doing. and despite the fear of seeing tens of thousands of web sites and iphones sporting glaring guardian logos and the newspaper's current ad campaigns  we're curious to see what applications rear their heads. since developers are free to run their own ads alongside those of the guardian  there's commercial promise for developers exploiting the api  and that could make for apps that don't actually suck.  why this is an important step for newspaper publishing  this kind of pro-activeness  to move from being just a newspaper web site  to a global source for current and historic knowledge  is admirable. it's indicative of one way publishers can monetise content in the future  as publishing moves away from print  and the web moves away from just sites.  but whether or not it succeeds as a free and ad-supported medium remains to be seen  and the terms and conditions state the service could be axed at any time. for now  developers should head here for all the technical details  or for a working example  have a look at the cass sculpture foundation's web site  which is already pulling in news content about its artists.
tech,bbc,2020,tech bug keeps mazda radios locked  in to npr a national public radio network has become a must-listen for some mazda drivers in washington state  as a tech bug means they are unable to retune.  owners of 2014-17 mazdas  in the puget sound area  contacted kuow to report their infotainment systems were permanently locked in to the network.  missing file extensions in album images sent with its digital-radio broadcast reportedly triggered the glitch.  the fix  according to mazda  requires the replacement of a component.  'can't change' 'we know lots of you always keep your car radio tuned to kuow - but now some drivers don't have a choice ' kuow told listeners.  scott smith  in seattle  told the network his on-screen menu would not stop cycling through options.  'i tried rebooting it because i've done that in the past - and nothing happened ' he said.  'i realised i could hear npr - but i can't change the station  can't use the navigation  can't use the bluetooth.'  kuow said local mazda dealerships had been 'flooded with calls'.  'i took my car to the shop this morning and they mentioned 50 customers are currently in the same situation  all stuck on kuow.'  mazda north american operations said: 'a radio station in the seattle area sent image files with no extension (eg missing '.jpeg' or '.gif')  which caused an issue on some 2014-17 mazda vehicles with older software.  'mazda north american operations (mnao) has distributed service alerts advising dealers of the issue.'  the fix requires the replacement of the $1 500 connectivity master unit  reports say.  but mazda said customers could apply for a free 'goodwill' replacement.  'while dealers are currently experiencing parts delays due to shipping constraints  mnao will support impacted customers with replacement parts ' it added.
tech,bbc,2020,apple moves to stop airtag tracking misuse  apple plans to introduce a number of changes to make it harder to misuse airtags to track someone.  the button-sized devices are designed to work with apple's 'find my' network to locate lost items.  the company said its changes to the device will make suspicious tags easier to find  and alert users earlier that an airtag may be travelling with them.  in january  a number of women told the bbc they had been followed using airtags.  apple launched airtags in april last year. the small  circular devices can be attached to luggage or keys - anything you could lose.  but the devices can be misused to track people by being hidden in a car  or on a personal item such as a bag.  as part of the changes to make misuse harder  apple said every user setting up their airtag for the first time will see a message warning that using the device to track people without consent is a crime in many regions around the world.  currently  iphone users (and android users who download an app) receive 'unwanted tracking' alerts if an unknown airtag moves with them.  apple announced that people will be alerted earlier that an unknown airtag is travelling with them.  and when people are warned of 'unwanted tracking' by an airtag  users of iphone 11  iphone 12  and iphone 13 devices will be able to use 'precision finding'  to see the distance and direction to an unknown airtag when it is in range. previously only the owner of the airtag could do this. currently ios users can send an unwanted tracking alert to make the suspect airtag play tones and apple has said tags will use louder tones in the future to make the tag easier to locate.  the company said it will also add to a feature that makes an airtag that hasn't been with the person who registered it for an extended period of time  play a sound when moved.  in theory this could reveal the presence of an airtag to a stalking victim  but recent reports revealed that airtags with the internal speakers deactivated had been listed for sale online.  to counter this  when the sound is triggered and the airtag is detected moving with an iphone  ipad  or ipod touch  an alert will also appear on that device.  apple also said it will also update its support article on unwanted tracking with additional information and resources.
tech,other,2020,sony trains ai to leave world’s best gran turismo drivers in the dust  ‘gt sophy’ honed tactics and technique to beat 95% of human players of playstation game after two days. having thrashed mortal champions at poker  chess  go  and starcraft  an artificial intelligence program has delivered another humiliation  leaving the world’s best video game racing drivers in the dust.  researchers at sony trained an ai called gt sophy to play the playstation game gran turismo and found that it could outrace 95% of human players after two days and continued to shave tenths of a second off its lap times over the following week.  beyond learning the fastest line to take around different race tracks  gt sophy honed its tactics around acceleration and braking  when to tuck in behind a fast car in front  and when to break out of the slipstream and attempt to overtake. faced with cars that blocked its path  gt sophy switched to another racing line to bypass those ahead.  to add to the challenge  gt sophy had to take account of race penalties that were dished out for infringements based on ambiguous rules – echoing the fine human judgements that can make the difference between winning and losing in formula one.  “the success of gt sophy in this environment shows for the first time that it is possible to train ai agents that are better than the top human racers across a range of car and track types ” the authors write in the journal nature.  the team led by peter wurman  the director of sony ai america  based gt sophy on a common ai technique called reinforcement learning. the ai was fed information from multiple gran turismo games and by maximising rewards for fast lap times and minimising penalties for collisions and such like  the program steadily mastered the game.  as with other ais that have trounced human champions  there is more to gt sophy than playing games. excelling at gran turismo demonstrates how an ai can learn strategies for working in a demanding situation where the vagaries of human judgment are crucial. for example  it may seem sensible to drive as close as possible to the car in front  but if the lead driver touches the brakes too early  the inevitable rear-ending suggests the strategy needs more work.  more importantly  the breakthrough will feed into a debate about the best computational approaches to use in driverless cars. neural networks of the kind that underpin gt sophy and other ais  such as those from deepmind  have proven themselves at identifying objects in the world  but other driving tasks such as planning the best line to take are often based on pure physics. gt sophy suggests neural networks might do a good job of this too.  despite the ai’s impressive debut  the sony team concede that gt sophy still has much to learn. on a long straight  the ai overtakes at the first opportunity  sometimes leaving enough road for the opponent to use gt sophy’s slipstream and pass back. without collision penalties  the authors noted gt sophy became “notably more aggressive”.  in an accompanying article in nature  prof christian gerdes  co-director of the center for automotive research at stanford university  who was not involved in the research  writes: “what really stands out is gt sophy’s performance against human drivers in a head-to-head competition. far from using a lap-time advantage to outlast opponents  gt sophy simply outraces them.”
tech,other,2020,tinder takes dating back to the 90s with blind date feature  app says generation z users want to sample what dating was like in pre-smartphone era. from low-rise jeans to reruns of the sitcom friends  generation z has a seemingly endless appetite for 90s and early 00s nostalgia.  now that extends to their romantic lives  as tinder has introduced a blind date feature to boost its popularity among young people – by enabling them to meet partners in a way that resembles the pre-smartphone era.  the new feature on the dating app matches people based on preferences  and enables them to make conversation before they are allowed to view each other’s photos. it will shortly be available in the us before being expanded globally.  tinder says the feature is intended to respond to demands from generation z  usually defined as people born between 1997 and 2012  for more authentic connections as a backlash to online dating’s earlier emphasis on superficial judgments based on preened instagram-ready photos on dating profiles.  a survey of 1 000 18-24-year-olds in the uk commissioned by the app found that a fifth said they would like to try blind dating as it would enable them to meet people they might otherwise have overlooked.  tinder said: “inspired by the og way to meet someone new  usually at the hand of a meddlesome aunt or well-meaning friend  blind date gives the daters of today a low-pressure way to put their personality first and find a match they truly vibe with.  “the experience reflects the modern dating habits of gen z  who value authenticity  and also taps into their 90s nostalgia with a callback to dating in a pre-smartphone world.”  the company said its early testing suggested that members who used the blind date feature made 40% more matches than when their profiles were visible. the blind date feature functions by asking users to complete a series of icebreaker-style questions  and then pairing them with others based on similar responses. users then enter a timed chat in which they only receive these answers as prompts  including responses to questions such as “it’s ok to wear a shirt ____ times without washing it” and “i put ketchup on____”. when the timer runs out  users can like the other person’s profile  and if there’s a match they can see photos and continue chatting.  blind date is part of a new suite of interactive games on tinder named explore  which is targeted at gen z consumers and with an interface that has been likened to tiktok. these include swipe night  a choose-your-own-adventure game  and hot takes  where users discuss controversial opinions.  tinder first launched on a us college campus in 2012  and was initially met with some suspicion. a now-infamous vanity fair article in 2015 warned that it would usher in a “dating apocalypse” and the end of romance. in the decade since  it has transformed how people meet romantic partners  and is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people.
